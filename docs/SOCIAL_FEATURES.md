## 📝 Next Steps

### 1. Seed Data
Create seed data for leaders, organizations, and causes:

```python
# scripts/seed_social_data.py
from api.models import Leader, Organization, Cause
from api.database import SessionLocal

db = SessionLocal()

# Add Tuscaloosa Mayor
leader = Leader(
    name="Walter Maddox",
    slug="walter-maddox",
    title="Mayor",
    office="Office of the Mayor",
    city="Tuscaloosa",
    state="Alabama",
    jurisdiction="City of Tuscaloosa",
    email="mayor@tuscaloosa.com",
    follower_count=0,
    is_verified=True
)
db.add(leader)

# Add causes
causes = [
    Cause(
        name="Oral Health",
        slug="oral-health",
        description="Access to dental care and oral health education",
        category="health",
        color="#354F52",
        follower_count=0
    ),
    Cause(
        name="Affordable Housing",
        slug="affordable-housing",
        description="Creating affordable housing opportunities",
        category="housing",
        color="#52796F",
        follower_count=0
    ),
    # Add more...
]

db.add_all(causes)
db.commit()
```

## 🎨 Design Principles

### LinkedIn/Facebook Patterns Used

1. **Follow Button States:**
   - Not following: Blue "Follow" button
   - Following: White "Following" button with check
   - Hover on following: Red "Unfollow" button

2. **Profile Layout:**
   - Large avatar at top
   - Stats prominently displayed
   - Tabbed content for different categories

3. **Social Proof:**
   - Follower counts visible everywhere
   - Verification badges for trusted entities
   - "X people follow this" messaging

4. **Discovery:**
   - Follow buttons on all entity cards
   - Empty states with clear CTAs
   - Category-based browsing

### Plain Language

- ✅ "Charities" instead of "Nonprofits"
- ✅ "Leaders" instead of "Officials"
- ✅ "Following" instead of "Subscribed"
- ✅ "Followers" instead of "Subscribers"

---

## 🔐 Authentication

All follow endpoints require authentication:
- User must be logged in via OAuth (HuggingFace, Google, Facebook, GitHub)
- JWT token passed in Authorization header
- `get_current_user` dependency validates token

**Error Responses:**
```json
{
  "detail": "Not authenticated"
}
```
