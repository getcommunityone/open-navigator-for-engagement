# Video Channel Discovery: Current State & Enhancement Plan

## Executive Summary

**Question:** Does this repo look at local government websites and attempt to discover their YouTube, Facebook, or other video channels?

**Answer:** 
- ❌ **Currently NO** - The repo does NOT scrape government websites for social media links
- ✅ **Partially YES** - It extracts video URLs from pre-existing datasets (MeetingBank, Open States)
- ✅ **NEW** - We've created `social_media_discovery.py` to implement your suggestion

---

## Current State: What Exists

### ✅ Video Discovery from Datasets (Offline Sources)

**1. MeetingBank (HuggingFace)**
- **File:** [`discovery/meetingbank_ingestion.py`](../discovery/meetingbank_ingestion.py)
- **Status:** ✅ **Working** - Video URLs ARE being extracted
- **Coverage:** 1,366 meetings from 6 cities
- **Video Sources:**
  - YouTube URLs (extracted from `urls['youtube_id']`)
  - Vimeo URLs (extracted from `urls['vimeo_id']`)
  - Archive.org collections (alameda, boston, denver, king-county, long-beach, seattle)

**2. Open States (API)**
- **File:** [`discovery/openstates_sources.py`](../discovery/openstates_sources.py)
- **Status:** ✅ Working
- **Coverage:** 50+ state legislatures
- **Extracts:** YouTube channels, Vimeo accounts, Granicus portals from jurisdiction metadata

**3. City Scrapers (GitHub)**
- **File:** [`discovery/city_scrapers_urls.py`](../discovery/city_scrapers_urls.py)
- **Status:** ⚠️ Partial - extracts start_urls but not video links yet
- **Coverage:** 100-500 agencies from Chicago, Pittsburgh, Detroit, Cleveland, LA
- **Note:** Granicus video pages with embedded YouTube, but extraction not fully implemented

### ❌ What's Missing: Website Scraping for Social Media

**Current Gap:**
The repo discovers government homepage URLs but does NOT:
1. ❌ Scrape those websites for social media links
2. ❌ Extract YouTube/Facebook channels from footers
3. ❌ Check "Contact Us" or "About" pages
4. ❌ Use USA.gov or federal aggregators

**Existing Homepage Discovery:**
- **File:** [`discovery/url_discovery_agent.py`](../discovery/url_discovery_agent.py)
- **What it does:**
  - ✅ Finds government homepage URLs using GSA .gov registry
  - ✅ Tests URL patterns (cityname.gov, etc.)
  - ✅ Crawls to find minutes/agenda pages
  - ❌ **But does NOT look for social media links**

---

## Your Suggestion: Federal Aggregators & Website Scraping

### Excellent Ideas!

#### 1. USA.gov Local Directory
```
✅ Most accurate way to verify channels are legitimate
✅ Provides official website for every city/county
✅ Most governments link social media in footer/contact sections
```

**Implementation:** See section below on how to integrate.

#### 2. USA.gov/archive (Federal Videos)
```
⚠️ Good for federal agencies
⚠️ Limited local government coverage
✅ Could supplement state-level sources
```

**Use Case:** State agencies and federal programs that touch local policy.

---

## NEW Implementation: Social Media Discovery

We've created a new module to implement your suggestion!

### File: `discovery/social_media_discovery.py`

**What it does:**
1. ✅ Takes government homepage URLs (from existing discovery)
2. ✅ Scrapes footer sections for social media links
3. ✅ Checks common contact/about pages
4. ✅ Extracts YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo, Archive.org, Granicus
5. ✅ Validates and cleans URLs
6. ✅ Batch processing for hundreds of jurisdictions

**Example Usage:**
```python
from discovery.social_media_discovery import SocialMediaDiscovery

jurisdictions = [
    {
        'jurisdiction_id': 'seattle-wa',
        'homepage_url': 'https://www.seattle.gov',
        'jurisdiction_name': 'Seattle',
        'state': 'WA'
    }
]

async with SocialMediaDiscovery() as discovery:
    results = await discovery.discover_batch(jurisdictions)

# Results:
# [
#   {
#     'jurisdiction_name': 'Seattle',
#     'social_media': {
#       'youtube': ['https://www.youtube.com/@cityofseattle'],
#       'facebook': ['https://www.facebook.com/CityofSeattle'],
#       'twitter': ['https://twitter.com/CityofSeattle']
#     },
#     'platform_count': 3,
#     'total_urls': 3
#   }
# ]
```

**Detection Strategy:**
- Focus on footer sections (most reliable)
- Common CSS selectors: `footer`, `[class*="footer"]`, `[class*="social"]`
- Pattern matching for platform URLs
- Validates against known domain patterns

---

## Integration with Existing Pipeline

### How Social Media Discovery Fits In

```
1. URL Discovery Agent (EXISTING)
   └─> Finds government homepage URLs
        └─> Uses GSA .gov registry
        └─> Pattern matching (cityname.gov)
        └─> Validates URLs

2. Social Media Discovery (NEW) ⬅️ Add this step
   └─> Scrapes homepages for social links
        └─> Checks footer sections
        └─> Checks contact/about pages
        └─> Extracts YouTube, Facebook, etc.

3. Meeting Scraper (EXISTING)
   └─> Uses discovered URLs to scrape meetings
```

### Integration Code Example

```python
from discovery.url_discovery_agent import URLDiscoveryAgent
from discovery.social_media_discovery import SocialMediaDiscovery
from discovery.gsa_domains import load_gsa_domains

# Step 1: Discover government websites
gsa_domains = load_gsa_domains()
url_agent = URLDiscoveryAgent(gsa_domains)

jurisdictions = [...]  # From Census data
discovered_urls = await url_agent.discover_batch(jurisdictions)

# Step 2: NEW - Discover social media from those websites
social_discovery = SocialMediaDiscovery()
social_results = await social_discovery.discover_batch(discovered_urls)

# Step 3: Save to Bronze layer
save_to_bronze_layer(social_results, "social_media_channels")
```

## USA.gov Integration Guide

### Approach 1: Use USA.gov Local Directory as Homepage Source

**What USA.gov Provides:**
- Official .gov website for every city/county
- Most authoritative source for homepage URLs
- Can replace/supplement GSA domain matching

**Implementation:**
```python
# discovery/usa_gov_directory.py (NEW FILE TO CREATE)

import httpx
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

async def get_usa_gov_local_directory():
    """
    Scrape USA.gov local directory for official city/county websites.
    
    USA.gov maintains a directory at:
    https://www.usa.gov/local-governments
    
    Each state page lists cities/counties with official websites.
    """
    base_url = "https://www.usa.gov/local-governments"
    
    # 1. Get list of states
    # 2. For each state, get list of cities/counties
    # 3. Extract official website URLs
    # 4. Return structured data
    
    pass  # Implementation details


# Then use in url_discovery_agent.py:
def _match_usa_gov_directory(jurisdiction_name, state):
    """
    Match jurisdiction to USA.gov directory entry.
    
    Higher confidence than pattern matching because it's
    verified by federal government.
    """
    usa_gov_url = lookup_usa_gov_directory(jurisdiction_name, state)
    if usa_gov_url:
        return (usa_gov_url, 0.98)  # Very high confidence
    return None
```

### Approach 2: USA.gov/archive for Federal Video Content

**Use Case:** State health departments, federal programs

```python
# discovery/federal_video_sources.py (NEW FILE TO CREATE)

FEDERAL_VIDEO_CHANNELS = {
    "cdc": {
        "youtube": "https://www.youtube.com/@CDCgov",
        "topics": ["public_health", "oral_health"]
    },
    "hrsa": {
        "youtube": "https://www.youtube.com/@HRSAgov",
        "topics": ["health_centers", "dental_programs"]
    },
    "state_health_depts": {
        # Each state's health department
        "CA": "https://www.youtube.com/@CAPublicHealth",
        "TX": "https://www.youtube.com/@TXHealthHumanServices",
        # ... all 50 states
    }
}

def get_federal_video_sources():
    """
    Get federal agency video channels relevant to oral health policy.
    
    Sources:
    - usa.gov/archive featured channels
    - State health departments
    - CDC, HRSA, CMS channels
    """
    pass
```

### Approach 3: ELGL Top YouTube Channels (NEW - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!)

**What:** ELGL (Engaging Local Government Leaders) publishes curated "Top Local Government YouTube Channels" lists

**Why This is Excellent:**
```

- Annual "Top Local Gov YouTube Channels" articles
- Digital innovation showcases

**Expected Coverage:** 50-100 top-tier channels (most active, highest quality)

**Implementation:** See `discovery/curated_sources.py`

### Approach 4: NACo County Database (NEW - COMPREHENSIVE!)

**What:** National Association of Counties maintains database of all 3,143 U.S. counties

**Why This is Excellent:**
```
✅ Complete county coverage (all 3,143 counties)
✅ Official website URLs verified by NACo
✅ Digital innovation showcase
✅ Authoritative source for county data
✅ Partnership opportunities
```

**Sources:**

## Performance & Scalability

### Current Approach (Dataset-Only)
- ✅ Fast (no web requests)
- ✅ Reliable (static datasets)
- ❌ Limited coverage (only cities in datasets)
- ❌ Stale data (datasets not updated frequently)

### New Approach (Website Scraping)
- ⚠️ Slower (requires web requests)
- ⚠️ Less reliable (websites change)
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage (all cities with websites)
- ✅ Fresh data (real-time discovery)

### Hybrid Strategy (RECOMMENDED)
1. **Start with datasets** (MeetingBank, Open States)
   - Get 1,366 meetings with videos immediately
   - High confidence, validated data
   
2. **Supplement with website scraping**
   - Fill gaps for cities not in datasets
   - Discover newly created channels
   - Verify dataset URLs are still valid

3. **Use USA.gov for verification**
   - Highest confidence for homepage URLs
