**Next Steps:**
1. Create `discovery/google_civic_integration.py`
2. Add API key to `.env`: `GOOGLE_CIVIC_API_KEY=your-key`
3. Implement endpoints:

## 🎯 The "Free Stack" for School Boards & Civic Data

Since school board data is the **hardest to find for free**, here's how to combine FREE sources:

| Source | Best Use Case | API Type | File |
|--------|---------------|----------|------|
| **Wikidata** | Relationships (People → Boards) | SPARQL | `wikidata_integration.py` |
| **Google Civic** | Address → Specific Board | REST | `google_civic_integration.py` |
| **NCES** | Official District IDs & Boundaries | CSV | `nces_ingestion.py` |
| **DBpedia** | Autocomplete & Context | Lookup | `dbpedia_integration.py` |
| **Open States** | State-Level Officials & Bills | REST | `openstates_sources.py` |

### How They Work Together:

**1. User enters address in search box:**
- **DBpedia Lookup** → Autocomplete suggestions as they type
- **Google Civic API** → Maps address to exact school board district
- **NCES Data** → Official district ID, boundaries, demographics

**2. User wants to see school board members:**
- **Wikidata SPARQL** → "Find all members of [School Board Name]"
- **Wikidata** → Links each person to their organizations
- **DBpedia** → Rich context from Wikipedia (photos, bio, etc.)

**3. User wants state-level info:**
- **Open States API** → State legislators, bills, committees
- **Wikidata** → State government structure, officials
- **DBpedia** → State context and background

**Example Query Flow:**
```
User types: "Tuscaloosa schools"
  ↓
DBpedia: Autocomplete → "Tuscaloosa City Schools"
  ↓
User enters address: "123 Main St, Tuscaloosa, AL"
  ↓
Google Civic: → Maps to "Tuscaloosa City School District"
  ↓
NCES: → Gets official district ID, enrollment, demographics
  ↓
Wikidata: → Finds all school board members
  ↓
DBpedia: → Gets rich Wikipedia context for each member
```

## 🏆 Why Wikidata + DBpedia are Game-Changers

### **Wikidata = The Relationship Database**
- Find **all school board members** in a state
- See **every organization** a person belongs to
- Link **people → positions → locations**
- Example: "Walt Maddox" → Mayor → Tuscaloosa → School Board connections

### **DBpedia = The Autocomplete Engine**
- **Perfect for search boxes** - Lookup API designed for type-ahead
- Type "Tusc" → Get instant suggestions
- Every Wikipedia page = structured data
- Get Mayor, population, district info instantly

### **Together They're Unbeatable:**
1. **DBpedia** for autocomplete (fast, optimized for search)
2. **Wikidata** for relationships (deep, interconnected data)
3. **Google Civic** for address mapping (precise, official)
4. **NCES** for official IDs (authoritative, complete)
5. **Open States** for state-level (comprehensive, up-to-date)

**All FREE. No paid services needed!** 🎉
