# URL Dataset Investigation: What Already Exists

## 🔍 Current Situation

**What we're doing now**:
- Matching Census jurisdiction names to CISA .gov domains
- Result: 76 URLs from 500 jurisdictions tested (15% match rate)

**What we should check**:
- Do these civic tech projects already have URL datasets?
- Are there HuggingFace datasets with government URLs?
- Can we download their jurisdiction lists instead of discovering ourselves?

## 🗂️ HuggingFace Datasets to Check

### Search Terms:

## 📋 Other Data Sources

### 1. Legistar Client List
**Why**: Legistar is the most popular council management system

**To Check**:

## 🎯 OPTIMAL STRATEGY

Instead of trying to match jurisdiction names to domains, we should:

### Phase 1: Download Existing Datasets (1-2 days)
1. **LocalView dataset** → Likely has 100s-1000s of URLs with videos
2. **CivicBand database** → 1,000+ municipalities
3. **CDP deployments** → 10-20 cities (high quality)
4. **City Scrapers instances** → 5+ cities, 100s of agencies
5. **Councilmatic deployments** → 6+ major cities
6. **MeetingBank** → 6 cities with transcripts

**Expected total**: 2,000-5,000 high-quality URLs

### Phase 2: Platform Client Lists (1 week)
1. **Legistar subdomain enumeration** → city.legistar.com
2. **Granicus client list** → From their website
3. **CivicPlus client list**
4. **Municode directory**

**Expected total**: 5,000-10,000 URLs

### Phase 3: Census + CISA Matching (current approach)
Keep our current system as fallback for uncovered jurisdictions

**Expected additional**: 1,000-2,000 URLs

## 🔥 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

### 1. Check LocalView Dataset
```bash
# Visit: https://www.localview.net
# Look for: "Download" or "Data" link
# Check: GitHub repo for dataset links
```

### 2. Check HuggingFace
```bash
# Search: https://huggingface.co/datasets?search=local+government
# Search: https://huggingface.co/datasets?search=council+meetings
```

### 3. Scrape Legistar Subdomains
```python
# Try common patterns:
# {city}.legistar.com
# {city}-{state}.legistar.com
# {county}.legistar.com
```

### 4. CDP Deployment List
```bash
# Check: https://councildataproject.org
# Each deployment has a URL in the config
```

### 5. City Scrapers Jurisdiction List
```bash
# Check: https://github.com/city-scrapers/city-scrapers
# Each scraper file = 1 or more agencies
```

## 💡 WHY THIS MATTERS

**Current approach**: 76 URLs from 500 jurisdictions = 15% match rate

**Using existing datasets**: Could get 5,000-10,000 URLs immediately

**ROI**: 
- LocalView alone might have 1,000+ URLs ready to use
- Legistar enumeration could yield 3,000+ URLs
- Combined: 10x more coverage with less work

---

## 📝 RECOMMENDATION

**DO THIS FIRST**:
1. ✅ Investigate LocalView dataset (highest potential)
2. ✅ Check HuggingFace for government data
3. ✅ Enumerate Legistar subdomains (legistar.com/*.legistar.com)
4. ✅ Get CDP deployment URLs
5. ✅ Extract City Scrapers jurisdiction lists

**THEN**:
Keep our Census + CISA matching as a fallback for smaller jurisdictions not covered by above.

## ⚠️ KEY INSIGHT

We've been trying to **discover** URLs when we should be **downloading** existing URL lists from projects that already did this work!

The civic tech community has likely already mapped thousands of URLs. We should:
1. Download their datasets
2. Extract their URL lists
3. Add our discoveries to fill gaps

This is the "don't reinvent the wheel" principle applied to URL discovery.
