    BIRMINGHAM CITY COUNCIL REGULAR MEETING
    April 15, 2026 - 6:00 PM
    City Hall Council Chambers
    
    PRESENT: Mayor Woodfin, Council President Scales, Councilors Smith,
    Johnson, Martinez, Davis, Brown, Wilson, Thompson, Lee
    
    AGENDA ITEM 3: RESOLUTION 2026-045
    Community Water Fluoridation Program Implementation
    
    Mayor Woodfin: "Tonight we are considering Resolution 2026-045, which
    would implement a community water fluoridation program for Birmingham's
    municipal water system. Dr. Sarah Johnson from the Alabama Department
    of Public Health is here to present."
    
    Dr. Johnson: "Thank you, Mayor. Community water fluoridation is recognized
    by the CDC as one of the ten great public health achievements of the 20th
    century. It's a safe, effective, and equitable way to prevent tooth decay
    across all age groups and socioeconomic levels.
    
    The proposed program would adjust fluoride levels in Birmingham's water
    to 0.7 mg/L, consistent with CDC and American Dental Association guidelines.
    Research shows this reduces tooth decay by 25% in children and adults.
    
    We estimate the program would cost $120,000 annually in operation and
    maintenance. However, the economic benefits are substantial - for every
    dollar invested, we save approximately $10 in dental treatment costs.
    That's $1.2 million in prevented costs annually for Birmingham."
    
    Councilor Smith: "I've reviewed the financial analysis and support this
    initiative. Tooth decay is a significant problem in our community,
    particularly among children. This is a cost-effective prevention measure."
    
    Councilor Johnson: "I appreciate the presentation, but I'd like to hear
    from our residents before we vote. I propose we schedule a public hearing
    to gather community input."
    
    Mayor Woodfin: "That's a reasonable request. Let's schedule a public
    hearing for May 6th at 6:00 PM."
    
    MOTION by Councilor Smith, seconded by Councilor Martinez, to schedule
    a public hearing on Resolution 2026-045 for May 6, 2026 at 6:00 PM.
    
    VOTE: 9 Ayes, 1 No (Councilor Thompson)
    Motion carried.
    
    AGENDA ITEM 4: UPDATE ON MEDICAID DENTAL EXPANSION
    
    Health Director Martinez: "The state has approved expanded Medicaid dental
    coverage for adults. We're working with local dental clinics to ensure
    capacity. We expect 5,000 newly eligible residents in Birmingham."
    
    MEETING ADJOURNED at 8:15 PM
