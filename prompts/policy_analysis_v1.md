## Governance Meeting Transcript Deconstruction Prompt

## Objective
Your objective is to deconstruct a governance meeting transcript to expose the underlying logic of its outcomes. Do not provide a chronological summary; instead, pinpoint the specific drivers behind each decision, identify the key actors who steered the debate, and articulate the specific risks or resources at play.

**Competing Interpretations Requirements:**
For each decision, extract and contrast the rival ways stakeholders defined the problem — how they diagnosed its cause, assigned responsibility, proposed solutions, and ranked moral values. This analysis must explicitly capture:
- **Competing causal interpretations** (individual behavior vs system capacity, biology vs policy failure, etc.)
- **Moral value conflicts** (collective safety vs individual liberty, equity vs efficiency, etc.)
- **Normative tradeoffs** (whose interests are advanced, whose are constrained, which harms are accepted)
- **Dissenting diagnosis** (how opponents defined the problem, its cause, and what they proposed instead)
- **Staying power of the prevailing interpretation** (is this a new way of seeing the problem or an extension of prior ones, does it lock in a dominant narrative)

## Writing Style
Apply Smart Brevity discipline to every text field: open with a headline that front-loads the so-what, follow with a colon and the essential detail, cut everything else.

## Scope
This prompt must work across any type of governance meeting regardless of jurisdiction size, body type, formality level, or subject matter — including but not limited to city councils, fire district budget hearings, school boards, county commissions, planning boards, utility authorities, and special district meetings. Adapt gracefully: if a field is not applicable to the meeting type set it to null rather than forcing a value that does not fit.

## Video and Audio Sources
When the input is a **recording** (video or audio) rather than a written agenda/minutes PDF, treat timecodes as first-class evidence.

- Set `meeting.input_modality` to `video_recording`, `audio_recording`, or `mixed` when applicable; use `pdf_minutes`, `pdf_agenda`, or `transcript_text` for document-only inputs.
- Populate `meeting.media_sources[]` from the **MEDIA CONTEXT** block when provided (one row per distinct recording). Do not invent URLs — copy `canonical_url`, `page_url`, and `platform` exactly.
- For **each decision** heard in the recording, populate `media_citation` with:
  - `media_source_id` — which recording (e.g. `MS001`)
  - `timestamp_start` / `timestamp_end` — **elapsed time from the start of that recording** as `HH:MM` or `H:MM:SS` (wall-clock meeting time only if the recording states it)
  - Leave `playback_url`, `timestamp_start_seconds`, and `timestamp_end_seconds` as **null** (the pipeline computes deep links from timestamps)
- When analyzing a **chunk** of a longer file, timestamps must still be **recording elapsed from t=0 of the full meeting**, not offset within the chunk alone (add the chunk's start offset from MEDIA CONTEXT).
- Attribute quotes and votes to the timestamp where they occur; use `timestamp_end` when a debate spans multiple minutes.

**Platform notes (for humans reading Document 2):**
- **YouTube** — share links with `&t=…s` from `playback_url`
- **Vimeo** — `#t=…s` on the video page
- **SuiteOne / Granicus-style portals** — prefer `page_url` (event page); seek inside the embedded player to `timestamp_start`
- **Direct MP4** — fragment links may not seek in all browsers; portal URL is preferred when available

## Entity Identification and Cross-Query Linking
For every person, organization, legislation, financial item, and decision subject extracted from the transcript, generate stable cross-query identifiers so that entities can be linked across multiple meeting analyses without ambiguity.

- **Person slug rule:** normalize to `person_firstname_lastname_role_jurisdiction` all lowercase underscores no punctuation e.g. `person_jane_doe_council_member_college_place_wa`
- **Organization slug rule:** normalize to `org_shortname_jurisdiction` e.g. `org_goshen_fire_department_ny`
- **Legislation slug rule:** normalize to `leg_type_number_year_jurisdiction` e.g. `leg_ordinance_1042_2022_college_place_wa` — if no official number exists use a short descriptive label e.g. `leg_proposed_budget_fy2012_goshen_fire_ny`
- **Subject slug rule:** a subject is the specific real-world asset, policy, position, parcel, contract, or matter being acted on — distinct from the decision itself. Normalize to `subject_descriptive_name_jurisdiction` all lowercase underscores no punctuation e.g. `subject_fy2012_fire_department_budget_goshen_ny`. The subject slug must represent the underlying matter not the meeting action — the same subject must produce the same slug whether it surfaces in part one or part three of a multi-session meeting or across separate meetings entirely. If a legislation reference anchors the subject bind it via `canonical_leg_id`.

## Location and Postal Code Extraction
For each decision, extract the 5-digit ZIP code (postal_code), county FIPS code (county_fips), and county name (county) of the city or location associated with that decision. Determine these based on:
- The meeting location if the decision applies to that specific area
- The subject location if the decision pertains to a specific address, facility, parcel, or geographic area
- The jurisdiction's primary location if the decision is jurisdiction-wide
- Set to null if the location cannot be determined or if the decision applies to multiple locations

Priority order: specific subject location > meeting location > jurisdiction primary location. If a decision involves multiple distinct locations, use the primary location where the decision has the greatest impact.

**County extraction:** Based on the city name associated with the decision, determine:
- `county_fips`: The 5-digit FIPS code for the county (state FIPS + county FIPS, e.g., "01097" for Mobile County, Alabama)
- `county`: The full county name (e.g., "Mobile County", "Suffolk County", "Cook County")
- Use standard U.S. county naming conventions with "County" suffix (exceptions: Louisiana parishes use "Parish", Alaska boroughs use "Borough")
- Set to null only if the county cannot be determined from the city name or jurisdiction

## Theme Classification
Classify each agenda item under a primary theme and at most one secondary theme from this fixed list:

- Fiscal and Budget Management
- Infrastructure and Capital Projects
- Zoning and Land Use
- Public Safety and Emergency Services
- Environmental and Natural Resources
- Housing and Community Development
- Economic Development and Business
- Transportation and Mobility
- Education and Workforce
- Health and Human Services
- Civil Rights and Equity
- Governance and Administrative Policy
- Parks and Recreation
- Utilities and Public Works
- Technology and Innovation
- Legal and Compliance
- Intergovernmental Relations
- Public Engagement and Communications

## COFOG Mappings (per decision only)
COFOG codes are **never** meeting-level labels. For **each** row in `decisions`, set `primary_theme_cofog` from that decision's `primary_theme` and `secondary_theme_cofog` from `secondary_theme` (or null) using this table only — do not invent codes or attach COFOG to people, organizations, or agenda items without a matching decision.

| Theme | COFOG |
|---|---|
| Fiscal and Budget Management | COFOG-01 |
| Infrastructure and Capital Projects | COFOG-04 |
| Zoning and Land Use | COFOG-06 |
| Public Safety and Emergency Services | COFOG-03 |
| Environmental and Natural Resources | COFOG-05 |
| Housing and Community Development | COFOG-06 |
| Economic Development and Business | COFOG-04 |
| Transportation and Mobility | COFOG-04 |
| Education and Workforce | COFOG-09 |
| Health and Human Services | COFOG-07 |
| Civil Rights and Equity | COFOG-01 |
| Governance and Administrative Policy | COFOG-01 |
| Parks and Recreation | COFOG-08 |
| Utilities and Public Works | COFOG-06 |
| Technology and Innovation | COFOG-04 |
| Legal and Compliance | COFOG-01 |
| Intergovernmental Relations | COFOG-01 |
| Public Engagement and Communications | COFOG-01 |

## NTEE Major Group Codes
Assign the most specific NTEE code determinable from context for organizations. NTEE codes will also be extracted to decision topics based on the primary organizations involved.

| Code | Category |
|---|---|
| A | Arts Culture and Humanities |
| B | Education |
| C | Environment |
| D | Animal-Related |
| E | Health Care |
| F | Mental Health and Crisis Intervention |
| G | Disease and Disorder Research |
| H | Medical Research |
| I | Crime and Legal Services |
| J | Employment |
| K | Food Agriculture and Nutrition |
| L | Housing and Shelter |
| M | Public Safety and Disaster Relief |
| N | Recreation and Sports |
| O | Youth Development |
| P | Human Services |
| Q | International and Foreign Affairs |
| R | Civil Rights and Advocacy |
| S | Community Improvement |
| T | Philanthropy and Grantmaking |
| U | Science and Technology |
| V | Social Science |
| W | Public Policy |
| X | Religion |
| Y | Mutual Benefit |
| Z | Unknown |

## Financial Items
Extract every dollar value mentioned in the transcript into `financial_items` regardless of whether it is tied to a formal vote — include estimates, bids, appropriations, contract values, grants, fees, levy amounts, tax rates, and bond amounts.

## Multi-Session Meetings
If a meeting is one session of a multi-part series record that in `session_info` and use consistent subject slugs across all parts so that items can be joined later.

## Organization Classification
Assign an `org_type` to every organization without exception — do not default to Unknown if context permits a more specific classification. Flag lobbyists explicitly at both the person and organization level where applicable — set `is_lobbyist` to false and `lobbyist_clients` to empty array for all others. Record party affiliation for elected officials and political organizations where stated or publicly determinable — set to Nonpartisan or Unknown where not applicable.

## Voting
Formal votes may not exist in all meeting types — if a decision is made by consensus, acclamation, or directive rather than recorded vote set `vote_tally` fields to null and note the decision method in `decision_statement`.

## Mermaid Diagram Generation Rules

### Decision Timeline (diagram_timeline)
For each decision, generate a Mermaid timeline showing the chronological progression of that specific decision across meetings. Format as a valid Mermaid timeline string:
- Include `timeline` keyword at start
- Use timeline sections if the decision spans multiple meetings
- Quote all timestamps: `"09:00"`, `"14:30"`
- Use exactly one colon per entry
- Show: prior context → this meeting's action → next steps
- Keep entries concise (10 words or fewer per entry)
- Example format:
```
timeline
    title Budget Proposal FY2012
    section Prior Meetings
        "2011-09-15" : Initial budget draft presented
        "2011-10-05" : Public hearing held
    section This Meeting
        "09:00" : Final budget vote
        "09:45" : Amendments approved
    section Next Steps
        "2011-11-01" : Implementation begins
```

### Decision Mindmap (diagram_mindmap)
For each decision, generate a Mermaid mindmap showing the decision structure, stakeholders, and key relationships. Format as a valid Mermaid mindmap string:
- Include `mindmap` keyword at start
- Root node: decision topic
- Branch 1: Outcome and vote
- Branch 2: Key arguments (for/against)
- Branch 3: Stakeholders (decision makers, advocates, affected parties)
- Branch 4: Financial impacts if present
- Use indentation to show hierarchy (2 spaces per level)
- Keep node text concise (5-7 words max)
- Example format:
```
mindmap
  root((FY2012 Budget))
    Outcome
      APPROVED 4-1
      $2.1M total
    Arguments
      For
        Addresses critical needs
        Stays within levy cap
      Against
        Too high for recession
    Stakeholders
      Decision Makers
        Board voted 4-1
      Advocates
        Fire Chief supported
      Public
        3 residents opposed
    Financial
      $2.1M appropriation
      $50K contingency
```

## Output Instructions

Produce **two documents in sequence**. Document 1 is the **database import artifact** (strict JSON). Document 2 is human-readable markdown derived from Document 1. **Do not** skip Document 1, **do not** substitute a markdown-only report, and **do not** wrap Document 1 in markdown code fences.

### STEP 1 — JSON (required; import format)
Output the JSON object defined in the schema below and **nothing else** until you have closed the final curly brace of the root object.

- The response must **begin** with `{` (first non-whitespace character).
- No preamble, apology, explanation, section headings, or markdown outside the JSON.
- No ` ```json ` fences around Document 1.
- The JSON must be parseable by `JSON.parse()` with no modification.
- Every decision must include `primary_theme`, `primary_theme_cofog`, and (when applicable) `secondary_theme` / `secondary_theme_cofog` derived from the COFOG table above.

**CRITICAL:** For each decision in the `decisions` array, populate both `diagram_timeline` and `diagram_mindmap` fields with valid Mermaid syntax strings following the rules above. These strings must be escaped for JSON (use `\n` for newlines, escape quotes).

After the closing curly brace of the root object, output exactly this token on its own line with no surrounding text:

`---DOCUMENT_BREAK---`

### STEP 2 — Human-Readable Summary (required; not a substitute for JSON)
After the first break token, output a human-readable markdown document that **reflects the same facts** as Document 1. Apply Smart Brevity principles throughout. Structure the document as follows:

**Meeting Overview**
- Meeting identification (body name, type, date, location)
- Input modality (video, audio, PDF, mixed) and primary recording link if present
- Attendance summary
- Session context if multi-part

**Key Decisions** (one section per decision; use `decision_id` as the section anchor)
For each decision provide:
- **Decision ID:** [decision_id]
- **Topic headline** (from decision.headline field)
- **Themes:** Primary: [primary_theme] ([primary_theme_cofog]); Secondary: [secondary_theme] ([secondary_theme_cofog]) or none
- **Watch / listen:** [playback_url at timestamp_start, or "recording not linked"] — include `timestamp_start`–`timestamp_end` when known
- **Location:** [city name, county name if present, postal_code if present, or "jurisdiction-wide"]
- **Outcome:** [APPROVED/DENIED/etc] via [decision method]
- **Vote:** [if formal vote, summarize tally and note dissenting members]
- **What happened:** [synthesis of decision_statement and timeline.this_meeting]
- **Why it matters:** [synthesis of underlying_causes and tradeoffs]
- **Who influenced it:** [synthesis of power_map and arguments_for/against, explicitly noting lobbyist involvement where present]
- **How the problem was defined:**
  - **Prevailing interpretation:** [synthesis of narrative_analysis.dominant_narrative]
  - **Dissenting interpretations:** [synthesis of narrative_analysis.dissenting_interpretations]
  - **Competing explanations:** [synthesis of narrative_analysis.causal_interpretations showing rival diagnoses]
  - **Value conflict:** [synthesis of narrative_analysis.value_conflicts showing underlying tensions]
  - **Winners and losers:** [synthesis of narrative_analysis.tradeoff_analysis showing who gains/loses]
- **What was considered but rejected:** [from alternatives_considered if any]
- **Downstream effects:** [from consequences — immediate, medium, long-term]
- **Prior decisions this builds on:** [from precedents if any]
- **What must happen next for this to work:** [from dependencies if any]
- **What's unresolved:** [list unresolved items if any]
- **Financial impact:** [summarize linked financial_items if any]
- **Next steps:** [from timeline.next_steps if present]

**Financial Summary**
Table or list of all financial items with amount, type, and context

**People and Organizations**
Bullet list of key actors grouped by role with party affiliation and lobbyist status clearly marked

**Decision themes index** (optional quick reference — must match Document 1)
Markdown table with one row per decision: `decision_id` | `topic` | `primary_theme` | `primary_theme_cofog` | `secondary_theme` | `secondary_theme_cofog`

Do **not** add a separate meeting-level COFOG or theme summary that is not keyed by `decision_id`.

Format all dollar amounts with commas and currency symbols. Use bold for section headers and key terms. Keep each section concise — front-load the most important information.

This is the final output — no additional document breaks or timeline sections follow.

## Enforcement Rules

### Field Requirements
- Every field must be populated or explicitly set to null — do not omit fields
- Do not flatten disagreements — preserve conflict in `arguments_against` and `unresolved`
- Each `decision_id` must be unique within the document

### Cross-Reference and Linking Rules
- Every decision must carry a `subject_id` as its primary cross-meeting and cross-session link
- For multi-part meetings use the same subject slug in every session so items can be joined across parts
- All cross-references must resolve — `person_id`, `org_id`, `leg_id`, `subject_id`, `financial_item_id`, and `decision_id` must each match a real entry in their respective arrays
- Normalized slugs must be deterministic — the same real-world entity must always yield the same slug regardless of how it is referenced in the transcript or across sessions

### Lineage Type Assignment
Assign `lineage_type` as:
- **ORIGINATION** for first appearance of a subject
- **CONTINUATION** if previously discussed without resolution
- **AMENDMENT** if modifying a prior decision
- **REVERSAL** if overturning a prior decision
- **CLOSURE** if resolving the matter

### Voting Rules
- If no formal vote occurred set all `vote_tally` fields to null and record `decision_method` accurately
- All `vote_tally` member arrays must use `person_id` values not display names

### Lobbyist and Organization Classification
- `is_lobbyist` in `arguments_for` and `arguments_against` must be true only if the person is registered as a lobbyist or appearing on behalf of a paying client — default to false otherwise
- `org_type` must reflect the most specific classification context permits — do not default to Unknown if context permits a more specific classification

### NTEE Classification Rules
- For every organization in the `organizations` array, populate all three NTEE fields (`ntee_major_group`, `ntee_category_label`, `ntee_code`) when context permits — do not leave these null if the organization's cause area is determinable
- For subcategories, use hierarchical notation with greater-than separator (e.g., "Health > Dental & Oral Health", "Food Agriculture and Nutrition > Food Banks, Food Pantries")
- If only the major group is determinable, set `ntee_category_label` equal to `ntee_major_group`
- **Extract NTEE to decisions — CRITICAL HIERARCHY:**
  1. **First priority: Topic content analysis** — Analyze the decision topic, headline, and primary theme to determine if it relates to a specific cause area (health, education, environment, human services, youth, arts, etc.). Record basis as `"Topic Content"`.
  2. **Secondary NTEE codes** — If a topic spans multiple cause areas, assign a secondary NTEE code. For example: "School dental screening program" → Primary: E (Health Care > Dental & Oral Health), Secondary: B (Education)
  3. **Organization classification fallback** — If the topic is truly general administrative/governance (approving minutes, routine procedures), use the primary organization's NTEE code. Record basis as `"Organization Fallback"`.
  4. **Last resort: Public Policy (W)** — Only use "W - Public Policy" for purely procedural/administrative topics with no substantive cause area. Record basis as `"Administrative"`.
- **Examples of topic-based NTEE assignment (override organization's W code):**
  - "Youth program funding" → Primary: O (Youth Development), Secondary: null
  - "School lunch program" → Primary: K (Food Agriculture and Nutrition), Secondary: B (Education)
  - "Recycling education campaign" → Primary: C (Environment), Secondary: B (Education)
  - "Senior center renovation" → Primary: P (Human Services), Secondary: null
  - "Public health emergency" → Primary: E (Health Care), Secondary: M (Public Safety and Disaster Relief)
  - "Arts festival approval" → Primary: A (Arts Culture and Humanities), Secondary: null
  - "Disability awareness proclamation" → Primary: R (Civil Rights and Advocacy), Secondary: P (Human Services)
  - "Youth sports facility" → Primary: O (Youth Development), Secondary: N (Recreation and Sports)
- **Examples of truly Public Policy (W) topics:**
  - "Approve meeting minutes" → Primary: W (Administrative), Secondary: null
  - "Adopt council rules" → Primary: W (Administrative), Secondary: null
  - "Budget process timeline" → Primary: W (Administrative), Secondary: null
- When a decision involves multiple organizations with different NTEE codes, select the primary NTEE based on the most central organization
- Set decision-level NTEE fields to null only when the cause area is genuinely indeterminate from context
- **Always prioritize substantive cause areas (A-V, X-Y) over Public Policy (W)** — W should be the exception, not the default

### Underlying Causes Rules
- Make `underlying_causes` headlines specific and contextual — avoid generic abstractions like "Aging infrastructure" or "Statutory requirement"
- Root causes must explain WHY the decision was necessary not merely describe the category — e.g., prefer "Fire station roof leaking after 40 years" over "Aging infrastructure" or "State audit found gaps in payment records" over "Statutory requirement"
- Each underlying cause should be independently verifiable from the transcript — do not infer causes that were not discussed
- Assign a `cause_type` to every underlying cause using the controlled vocabulary: Structural, Proximate, Political, Resource, Legal, Crisis, or Demand
- Mark `contested: true` for any cause that was disputed by any party — these must also appear as competing entries in `narrative_analysis.causal_interpretations`
- Capture competing diagnoses of causality in `narrative_analysis.causal_interpretations` when stakeholders disagreed on root causes

### Alternatives Considered Rules
- Populate `alternatives_considered` whenever the transcript shows that another path was discussed, proposed, or implicitly rejected — even if briefly
- `rival_diagnosis_used_to_reject` captures the argumentative move where opponents redefined the problem to make an alternative seem irrelevant or harmful — this is the primary mechanism by which competing interpretations suppress options

### Consequences Rules
- Populate all three time horizons (`immediate`, `medium_term`, `long_term`) when effects were discussed or are clearly implied
- Use `certainty` to distinguish commitments from predictions: Certain = written into the decision; Probable = reasonably expected given stated plans; Possible = plausible but conditional; Speculative = asserted by one party without corroboration
- `affected_parties` must name specific person_ids, org_ids, or stakeholder groups — not generic categories like "the public"

### Precedents Rules
- Populate `precedents` whenever a prior decision, case, statute, or practice was cited — explicitly or implicitly — to justify or oppose the current decision
- `how_used` distinguishes between invoking a precedent to support an action ("To justify"), to argue this case is different ("To distinguish"), to warn of risks ("To caution against"), or to set a reference point ("To establish baseline")

### Dependencies Rules
- Populate `dependencies` whenever the decision cannot take effect on its own — it requires funding approval, legal authorization, another body's action, or operational steps
- `risk_if_unmet` should be specific: name the consequence of the dependency failing, not just "implementation delayed"

### Power Map Rules
- Every entry in `formal_authority`, `influence`, and `lobbyist_influence` must include an `influence_intensity` rating
- **Decisive**: this actor's position was necessary for the outcome — without them it likely fails
- **Significant**: this actor shaped the terms of debate or moved votes but was not singularly necessary
- **Marginal**: this actor participated but did not materially affect the outcome
- `affected_not_present` remains a flat array — these parties had no voice, so influence intensity is not applicable

### Competing Interpretations Rules
- Every decision must include a `narrative_analysis` object — do not omit this field
- Extract at minimum one dominant narrative and one dissenting interpretation where opposition exists
- `causal_interpretations` must capture competing diagnoses of causality not just competing outcomes
- `value_conflicts` must surface value tensions even when not explicitly named by participants
- `tradeoff_analysis` must identify whose interests are advanced and constrained as conscious choices
- Dissenting interpretations must extract problem/cause/remedy from opponents' perspective — not merely record that opposition existed
- `narrative_stability` must assess whether this decision establishes or extends a narrative arc for future policy on this subject
- When no dissenting interpretation was articulated (unanimous consent, no debate) set `dissenting_interpretations` to empty array and note absence of contest in `narrative_stability.narrative_durability.durability_assessment`

### URL and External References
- Where an official legislation or municipal code URL is determinable from context include it in the `url` field

### Media Citation Rules
- When `meeting.input_modality` is `video_recording` or `audio_recording`, every decision discussed in the recording must include `media_citation.timestamp_start` when the moment can be estimated
- Copy `timestamp_start` / `timestamp_end` to the top-level decision fields for backward compatibility
- Do not fabricate `playback_url` — set to null in Document 1
- `media_source_id` must reference a row in `meeting.media_sources` or null when no recording is linked

### Diagram Requirements
- Every decision must include both `diagram_timeline` and `diagram_mindmap` fields
- Timeline must show decision chronology: prior context → this meeting → next steps
- Mindmap must show decision structure: outcome, arguments, stakeholders, financial impacts
- Both diagrams must use valid Mermaid syntax escaped for JSON (newlines as `\n`, quotes escaped)
- Always quote timestamps in timeline diagrams: `"09:00"`, `"14:30"`
- Keep diagram node text concise: 10 words or fewer per entry

### Theme and COFOG Rules
- Classify themes **per decision** in `decisions[]` only — not at meeting root
- `primary_theme_cofog` must be the COFOG code from the table for that decision's `primary_theme`
- `secondary_theme_cofog` must be the COFOG code for `secondary_theme`, or null when `secondary_theme` is null
- Do not emit COFOG codes in Document 2 that are absent from or inconsistent with Document 1

### Output Format Requirements
- **Document 1 (JSON)** is mandatory and is the canonical structured record for downstream import
- **Document 1** must be parseable by `JSON.parse()` with no modification
- **Markdown-only output is invalid** — if you cannot produce valid JSON, still output a minimal valid JSON object with `"_error"` describing the failure, then the break token, then Document 2
- Output the two documents separated by `---DOCUMENT_BREAK---` with no other text outside the documents
- No markdown code fences around the JSON in Document 1
- Document 2 must not replace or omit fields present in Document 1 (especially per-decision themes and COFOG)
