Map LocalView jurisdictions (place_name + state) onto Census Gazetteer place GEOIDs,
and then onto counties via the place→county crosswalk.

Matching tiers (each only fires if the prior tier found nothing):
  1. Municipality     — bronze_jurisdictions_municipalities
  2. School district  — bronze_jurisdictions_school_districts
  3. County direct    — bronze_jurisdictions_counties (e.g. "Montezuma County, CO")
  4. Township         — bronze_jurisdictions_townships (e.g. "Hamilton township NJ")
     County derived from the township GEOID prefix (first 5 chars = state+county FIPS).
