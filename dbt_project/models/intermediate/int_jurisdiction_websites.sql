-- Relation in Postgres: intermediate.int_jurisdiction_websites (see dbt intermediate +schema).
-- Performance (ops): ``ANALYZE`` bronze sources after bulk loads; run ``EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)``
-- on compiled SQL under ``target/run/``. Index ``idx_int_jurisdictions_state_type`` is created by
-- ``dbt_project/scripts/ensure_int_jurisdictions_indexes.sh`` (called from ``dbt_project/setup.sh``)
-- because ``CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`` cannot run inside dbt's transaction. For heavy GSA name
-- joins, optionally ``SET work_mem = '256MB'`` in the session before ``dbt run`` (avoid embedding in
-- ``config(pre_hook=...)`` here: dbt's config parser rejects nested string quotes in some versions).
-- Query that schema/name after ``dbt run --select int_jurisdiction_websites`` — public.* may be stale/wrong.
--
-- After adding denylist rows: ``dbt seed --select jurisdiction_website_domain_denylist`` then rebuild this model.
-- Curated URLs: ``jurisdiction_website_url_overrides`` seed (``dbt seed --select jurisdiction_website_url_overrides``).
-- Python scrapers rank **override** (this seed) first, then **NACO over GSA** for ``county_*`` ids so
-- curated and NACo county URLs beat questionable GSA .gov registry matches. **League** municipal
-- directories union in after USCM with the same name-normalization join pattern.

-- Map GSA domain_type labels to the jurisdiction_type values used in int_jurisdictions
-- so the name-match join targets the right pool of records.
