/*
Staging view for bronze_events_cdp (Council Data Project events)

Applies basic cleaning and type casting to raw CDP event data.
Does NOT deduplicate - that happens in intermediate layer.

CDP Compatibility: Maps to Council Data Project Event and Session models
See: https://councildataproject.org/

Source: bronze_events_cdp (Council Data Project data)
Target: Intermediate models for deduplication and enrichment
