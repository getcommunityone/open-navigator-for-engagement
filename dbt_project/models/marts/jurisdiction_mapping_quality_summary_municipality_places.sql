/*
Municipality-only rollups split by Census Gazetteer **LSAD** (place kind):

- ``incorporated_city`` — LSAD ``25`` (legal incorporated city)
- ``census_designated_place`` — LSAD ``37`` (CDP)
- ``incorporated_other`` — other incorporated / statistical place codes (town, village, borough, …)
- ``unknown`` — municipality row with missing / blank LSAD

Same URL / mapping metrics as ``jurisdiction_mapping_quality_summary`` but grouped by
``municipality_place_kind`` instead of lumping all municipalities together.
