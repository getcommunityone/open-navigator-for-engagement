/*
Rollups for dashboards: mapping coverage by jurisdiction type and by canonical source flags.
Rates are ``with_* / total`` within each ``jurisdiction_type``.

Includes **URL shape / host-pattern** checks on the chosen primary URL (see
``jurisdiction_mapping_analysis``). There is **no** persisted HTTP status / reachability
in these tables — enrichment scripts may probe live URLs separately.
