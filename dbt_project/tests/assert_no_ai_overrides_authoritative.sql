/*
    Test: Assert AI extractions don't override authoritative sources
    
    This test checks that no contact with an authoritative datasource
    (openstates_api, irs_990, irs_bmf) was updated AFTER an AI extraction
    with the same normalized name.
    
    If this test returns rows, it means AI data incorrectly overwrote
    authoritative data.
