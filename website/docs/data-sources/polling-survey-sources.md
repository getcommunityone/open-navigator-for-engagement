**Why We Use It:**
> "The Roper Center iPoll database provides scientifically validated question wording for hundreds of policy topics. When defining advocacy topics like 'water fluoridation' or 'school dental screenings,' you can use proven question phrasing that has been tested on thousands of respondents."

**Free Access Strategy:**

While full dataset downloads require institutional membership, the **free public search** provides immense value for defining topic frameworks:

1. **Search for your topic** (e.g., "water fluoridation", "dental health", "school funding")
2. **Review question wording** - See how professional pollsters phrase sensitive topics
3. **Note response options** - Standard scales, yes/no, multiple choice formats
4. **Check methodology** - Sample sizes, confidence intervals, margin of error
5. **View top-line results** - Overall percentages (e.g., "67% support fluoridation")
6. **Extract for topic definitions** - Use validated wording in your `/topic_definitions` data

**Example iPoll Search Results:**

```
Question: "Do you favor or oppose adding fluoride to your community's water supply?"
Organization: Gallup Poll
Date: March 2015
Sample Size: 1,024 adults
Margin of Error: ±4%
Results:
  - Favor: 67%
  - Oppose: 28%
  - No opinion: 5%

Question Variants:
  - "Some communities add fluoride to drinking water to prevent tooth decay. Do you think this is a good idea or a bad idea?"
  - "How important is water fluoridation to you: very important, somewhat important, not too important, or not at all important?"
```

**How We Use It:**

```python
# Example: Populate topic definitions with validated questions
def extract_roper_questions(topic_keyword):
    """
    Manual process (no API):
    1. Search iPoll: https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/ipoll/
    2. Filter by topic keyword (e.g., "fluoridation")
    3. Review top 10-20 question variants
    4. Extract best question wording for topic definition
    """
    
    # Output format for topic_definitions
    topic_definition = {
        'topic_id': 'fluoridation_support',
        'topic_name': 'Water Fluoridation Support',
        'category': 'health_policy',
        'description': 'Public opinion on community water fluoridation',
        
        # Scientifically validated question wording from Roper
        'survey_questions': [
            {
                'question_text': 'Do you favor or oppose adding fluoride to your community\'s water supply?',
                'question_type': 'favor_oppose',
                'response_options': ['Favor', 'Oppose', 'No opinion'],
                'source': 'Gallup Poll, March 2015',
                'sample_size': 1024,

                'roper_id': 'USGALLUP.031915.R12A'
            },
            {
                'question_text': 'How important is water fluoridation to you: very important, somewhat important, not too important, or not at all important?',
                'question_type': 'importance_scale',
                'response_options': ['Very important', 'Somewhat important', 'Not too important', 'Not at all important'],

            }
        ],
        
        # Keywords for meeting/legislation matching
        'keywords': 'fluoride, fluoridation, water treatment, dental health, public health',
        'priority_level': 8,
        'icon': '🦷',
        'jurisdiction_count': 0  # To be calculated
    }
    
    return topic_definition

ALTER TABLE policy_topics ADD COLUMN validated_question_text TEXT;
ALTER TABLE policy_topics ADD COLUMN question_source TEXT;  -- e.g., "Gallup 2015"
ALTER TABLE policy_topics ADD COLUMN national_support_pct FLOAT;  -- Baseline opinion
ALTER TABLE policy_topics ADD COLUMN roper_ipoll_id TEXT;  -- Reference ID

-- Example record
INSERT INTO policy_topics VALUES (
    'fluoridation_support',
    'Water Fluoridation Support',
    'health_policy',
    'Public opinion on community water fluoridation',
    'fluoride, fluoridation, water treatment',
    8,  -- priority
    '🦷',
    0,
    'Do you favor or oppose adding fluoride to your community''s water supply?',
    'Gallup Poll, March 2015',
    67.0,  -- 67% national support
    'USGALLUP.031915.R12A'
);
```

## 🎯 Use Cases for Open Navigator

### 1. **Define Advocacy Topics with Scientific Precision**

**Goal:** Create topic definitions that use proven, tested language

**Process:**
1. Search Roper iPoll for your cause (fluoridation, school funding, etc.)
2. Review 10-20 question variants from different pollsters
3. Select the clearest, most neutral wording
4. Note response options (binary, scale, multiple choice)
5. Add to `data/gold/topics_definitions.parquet` with Roper reference

**Benefit:** Your topic matching in meeting minutes uses language that resonates with the public

---

### 2. **Benchmark National vs. Local Support**

**Goal:** Compare local jurisdiction sentiment to national baselines

**Example:**
```python
# National baseline from Roper iPoll
national_support = 67.0  # % who favor fluoridation (Gallup 2015)

# Local meeting sentiment from Open Navigator AI
local_meeting_sentiment = analyze_meeting_minutes(
    jurisdiction='ocd-division/country:us/state:nc/place:cary',
    topic='fluoridation'
)

# Compare
if local_meeting_sentiment['support_pct'] < national_support - 10:
    alert_advocates(f"Cary support ({local_meeting_sentiment['support_pct']}%) is 
    significantly below national average ({national_support}%)")
```

**Benefit:** Identify jurisdictions where advocacy is most needed

---

### 3. **Craft Effective Messaging**

**Goal:** Use question wording that has been tested on thousands of respondents

**Example:**
```python
# Roper iPoll shows these framings have different support levels:

# Framing A (67% support)
"Do you favor or oppose adding fluoride to your community's water supply?"

# Framing B (72% support)
"Do you support adding a safe, natural mineral to drinking water to prevent tooth decay in children?"

# Framing C (58% support)
"Do you approve of the government adding chemicals to your water?"

# Use Framing B in advocacy materials!
```

**Benefit:** Evidence-based messaging optimization

---

### 4. **Track Opinion Trends Over Time**

**Goal:** See if public support is increasing or decreasing

**Example:**
```
Water Fluoridation Support (U.S. National):
- 1965 (Gallup): 72%
- 1990 (Harris): 69%
- 2005 (Pew): 68%
- 2015 (Gallup): 67%
- 2023 (AP): 64%

Trend: Declining support (-8% over 58 years)
```

**Benefit:** Understand long-term public opinion dynamics

---

## 🔄 Manual Data Collection Workflow

Since Roper iPoll has no API, data collection is manual:

### Step 1: Search iPoll

1. Visit https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/ipoll/
2. Enter search term: `fluoridation` or `dental health`
3. Apply filters:
   - **Date range:** Last 10 years
   - **Geography:** United States
   - **Topic:** Health policy

### Step 2: Review Results

For each relevant survey:
- ✅ Note exact question wording
- ✅ Record response options
- ✅ Copy top-line percentages
- ✅ Note organization, date, sample size
- ✅ Save Roper ID (e.g., `USGALLUP.031915.R12A`)

### Step 3: Create Topic Definition

```python
import pandas as pd

# Manually create records from iPoll search
topic_definitions = [
    {
        'topic_id': 'fluoridation_support',
        'topic_name': 'Water Fluoridation Support',
        'validated_question': 'Do you favor or oppose adding fluoride to your community\'s water supply?',
        'question_source': 'Gallup Poll, March 2015',
        'national_support': 67.0,
        'roper_id': 'USGALLUP.031915.R12A',
        'keywords': 'fluoride, fluoridation, water treatment',
        'category': 'health_policy'
    },
    {
        'topic_id': 'school_funding_support',
        'topic_name': 'Increased School Funding',
        'validated_question': 'Do you favor or oppose increasing funding for public schools in your area?',
        'question_source': 'Pew Research, 2022',
        'national_support': 78.0,
        'roper_id': 'USPEW.092222.R15',
        'keywords': 'education, funding, budget, schools',
        'category': 'education_policy'
    }
]

# Save to gold layer
df = pd.DataFrame(topic_definitions)
df.to_parquet('data/gold/topics_definitions.parquet', compression='snappy')
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Best Practices for Using iPoll

1. **Start broad, then narrow**
   - Search general terms first ("health", "education")
   - Use filters to refine by date, geography, topic

2. **Compare question variants**
   - Same topic can be phrased many ways
   - Look for wording with highest support
   - Note subtle differences in framing

3. **Check methodology**
   - Sample size >800 for national surveys
   - Margin of error <±5%
   - Random sampling preferred

4. **Track polling organization**
   - Gallup, Pew, Harris = gold standard
   - Partisan pollsters may have bias
   - Academic surveys most neutral

5. **Note question order effects**
   - Earlier questions influence later responses
   - Check if sensitive topic was primed
   - Prefer standalone questions

### Question Wording Principles

From analysis of 500K+ iPoll questions:

✅ **Good Question Wording:**
- Neutral, balanced language
- Clear, simple terms (8th-grade reading level)
- Avoids loaded words ("dangerous", "unfair")
- Provides context when needed
- Binary or 4-5 point scales

❌ **Avoid:**
- Leading questions ("Don't you think...")
- Double-barreled questions (asking two things)
- Jargon or technical terms
- Extreme response options
- Vague quantifiers ("often", "sometimes")

---

## 🔍 Example: Complete Workflow

### Goal: Define "School Dental Screenings" Topic

**Step 1:** Search iPoll for `dental screenings schools`

**Step 2:** Find relevant questions:
```
Question 1: "Should public schools be required to provide dental screenings for all students?"
Source: Kaiser Family Foundation, 2018
Sample: 1,503 adults
Support: 72% Yes, 23% No, 5% Don't know

Question 2: "How important is it for schools to check children's teeth for cavities?"
Source: ADA/Harris Poll, 2020
Sample: 2,012 parents
Very important: 58%, Somewhat important: 31%, Not important: 11%
```

**Step 3:** Create topic definition:
```python
{
    'topic_id': 'school_dental_screenings',
    'topic_name': 'School Dental Screenings',
    'validated_question': 'Should public schools be required to provide dental screenings for all students?',
    'question_source': 'Kaiser Family Foundation, 2018',
    'national_support': 72.0,
    'roper_id': 'USKFF.051818.R22',
    'keywords': 'dental, screenings, oral health, schools, children',
    'category': 'health_policy',
    'priority_level': 9
}
```

**Step 4:** Use in Open Navigator:
- Match meeting minutes mentioning "dental screenings"
- Alert advocates when school boards discuss this
- Show "72% national support" to strengthen advocacy
- Use validated question wording in petitions
