- **Coverage:** Comprehensive vocabulary system for standardizing concepts across domains

**OMOP CDM Tables We Implement:**

| Table | Purpose | Our Use Case |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **CONCEPT** | Master vocabulary list | Standardized codes for topics, demographics, classifications |
| **VOCABULARY** | Source vocabularies | Track origin of concepts (NTEE, FIPS, Schema.org, etc.) |
| **CONCEPT_CLASS** | Categorization | Group concepts by type (demographic, geographic, topic) |
| **CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP** | Linkages | Map relationships between concepts (is-a, maps-to, subsumes) |

**Our OMOP-Inspired Vocabularies:**

| Vocabulary ID | Description | Concept Count |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| `NTEE` | National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities | 600+ |
| `FIPS` | Federal Information Processing Standards | 90,000+ |
| `Schema.org` | Structured data types | 800+ |
| `Popolo` | Open government data specs | 15+ |
| `OCD-ID` | Open Civic Data identifiers | 22,000+ |
| `CEDS` | Common Education Data Standards | 2,300+ |
| `CENSUS` | U.S. Census categories | 1,000+ |
| `INTERNAL` | Custom platform classifications | 500+ |

**Example Implementation:**
```sql
-- CONCEPT table: standardized demographics
concept_id | concept_name              | vocabulary_id | concept_class_id
-----------|---------------------------|---------------|------------------
100001     | Race: White               | CENSUS        | Demographic
100002     | Race: Black/African Amer. | CENSUS        | Demographic
100003     | Hispanic/Latino Ethnicity | CENSUS        | Demographic
100004     | Gender: Male              | CENSUS        | Demographic

-- CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP: hierarchies
concept_id_1 | concept_id_2 | relationship_id
-------------|--------------|----------------
100002       | 100000       | Is a           # Race category
100003       | 100010       | Is a           # Ethnicity category
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Consistent terminology across all datasets
- ✅ Hierarchical concept relationships

```

**Download Strategies:**

| Approach | Best For | Time | Bandwidth | Storage |
|----------|----------|------|-----------|---------|
| **Individual XMLs** | Single state or targeted | ~2 hrs (22K orgs) | 32 GB | 32 GB |
| **ZIP Archives** | All states / nationwide | ~6 hrs total | 38 GB | 95 GB |

**Choose Individual XMLs when:**
- You need data for 1-5 states only
- You want to download only specific EINs
- Storage space is limited
- You want incremental caching

**Choose ZIP Archives when:**
- You need all 50 states
- You're building a comprehensive database
- You have 100+ GB storage
- You want offline access to all filings

**What You Can Extract:**
- **Financials:** Revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, net income, grants paid/received
- **Programs:** Detailed program descriptions, accomplishments, expenses per program (up to 10)
- **Governance:** Officer compensation, board members, key employees (with names and titles)
- **Activities:** Legislative activities, lobbying expenses, political contributions
- **Mission:** Organization mission statement and activity descriptions
- **Website:** Organization website URLs
- **Grants:** List of grant recipients with amounts (for grantmaking organizations)
- **Custom Fields:** Any field in the IRS Form 990 schema (990, 990-EZ, 990-PF)

**S3 Access Examples:**

**Individual XMLs (for single state or targeted download):**
```bash
# List index files (no credentials needed)
aws s3 ls s3://gt990datalake-rawdata/Indices/990xmls/ --no-sign-request

# Download index (~925 MB)
aws s3 cp s3://gt990datalake-rawdata/Indices/990xmls/index_all_years_efiledata_xmls_created_on_2023-10-29.csv . --no-sign-request

# Download specific XML
aws s3 cp s3://gt990datalake-rawdata/EfileData/XmlFiles/202233259349300703_public.xml . --no-sign-request

# Batch download for single state (using our script)
python scripts/batch_download_990s.py --state MA --health-only --concurrent 1000
```

**ZIP Archives (for all states / nationwide):**
```bash
# Download all 97 ZIPs (~38 GB) to local directory
./scripts/download_990_zips.sh

# Extract all ZIPs to get ~384K XMLs (~95 GB)
./scripts/extract_990_zips.sh

# Build local index for fast lookup
python scripts/build_990_local_index.py

# Now enrich from local files (no network needed!)
python scripts/enrich_all_states_990.py
```

**Python Access:**
```python
import boto3
from botocore import UNSIGNED
from botocore.config import Config

# Configure anonymous S3 client
s3 = boto3.client('s3', config=Config(signature_version=UNSIGNED))

# Download individual XML
xml_obj = s3.get_object(
    Bucket='gt990datalake-rawdata',
    Key='EfileData/XmlFiles/202233259349300703_public.xml'
)
xml_content = xml_obj['Body'].read()

zip_obj = s3.get_object(
    Bucket='gt990datalake-rawdata',
    Key='EfileData/XmlZips/2023_TEOS_XML_01A.zip'
)
zip_content = zip_obj['Body'].read()
```

**Index Schema:**
The CSV index contains: `EIN`, `TaxPeriod`, `ObjectId`, `URL`, `FormType`, `OrganizationName`, `DLN`, `SubmittedOn`

**Key Advantages:**

### Spectrum of Community Engagement to Ownership

**Organization:** Facilitating Power, Rosa González  
**What we use:** Framework for community-driven governance that maps to our data structure (nonprofits, jurisdictions, grants, officials).

- **Source:** https://movementstrategy.org/
- **Framework:** https://movementstrategy.org/b/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Spectrum-of-Community-Engagement-to-Ownership.pdf
- **Article:** "From Community Engagement to Ownership"
- **License:** Creative Commons (educational use)

**The Spectrum Framework - Four Key Sectors:**

| Sector | Maps to Our Data | Community Role |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| **Community-Based Organizations** | `/nonprofits` | Grassroots leadership, lived experience |
| **City/County Staff** | `/jurisdictions` | Government accountability, service delivery |
| **Philanthropic Partners** | `/grants` | Resource allocation, funding equity |
| **Facilitative Leaders** | `/officials` | Elected officials, decision makers |

**Engagement Levels:**
1. **Inform** → One-way communication
2. **Consult** → Gather input, government decides
3. **Involve** → Work together on solutions
4. **Collaborate** → Shared decision-making
5. **Defer to** → Community-driven governance

**Real-World Case Studies:**

**Providence, RI: Racial and Environmental Justice Committee**
- **Challenge:** Environmental hazards disproportionately affect communities of color
- **Our Data:** `/jurisdictions/demographics` + `/nonprofits/environmental_orgs` + `/meetings/public_hearings`
- **Outcome:** Moved from "consulting" to "community-driven" - residents now co-chair committee
- **Metrics:** Track using `/analytics/metric_views` - meeting attendance, community proposals adopted

**Portland, OR: Equity Working Group**
- **Challenge:** Budget decisions lacked community input
- **Our Data:** `/budgets/city_budgets` + `/nonprofits/advocacy_orgs` + `/officials/city_council`
- **Outcome:** Participatory budgeting with community ownership
- **Metrics:** Track using `/analytics/dashboard_metrics` - community budget proposals, funding allocated

**How Our Platform Supports the Spectrum:**
- **Inform:** `/meetings/agendas` + `/documents` for transparency
- **Consult:** `/surveys` + `/factchecks` for informed input
- **Involve:** `/civic_tech/hackathons` + `/nonprofits/volunteer_activities`
- **Collaborate:** `/grants/participatory_budgeting` + `/legislation/co-creation`
- **Defer to:** `/analytics/community_impact_metrics`

### Brookings Institution: Data-Driven Policymaking

**Organization:** Brookings Institution, Center on Regulation and Markets  
**What we use:** Data Academy model for turning "Open Data" into "Accessible Data" - validates our `/domains` and `/standards` architecture.

- **Source:** https://www.brookings.edu/
- **Article:** "How Citizens and Local Governments Advance Data-Driven Policymaking"
- **License:** Public research

**The Data Academy Model:**

**Case Study: Tempe, AZ**

**Workflow:**
```
City Creates Dashboard → Residents Attend Data Academy → Data Informs Policy
     (/standards)             (/meetings/trainings)        (/legislation)
```

**Our Platform Support:**

| Stage | City Action | Our Data | Resident Outcome |
|-------|-------------|----------|------------------|
| **1. Publish** | Open data portal | `/standards/schema_org_jsonld` | Machine-readable datasets |
| **2. Train** | Data Academy | `/meetings/trainings` | Residents learn SQL, Tableau |
| **3. Analyze** | Dashboard access | `/analytics/dashboard_metrics` | Community-driven insights |
| **4. Advocate** | Public testimony | `/meetings/public_hearings` | Data-backed proposals |
| **5. Legislate** | Policy adoption | `/legislation/local_ordinances` | Evidence-based laws |

**Example: Tempe Water Conservation Policy**

**Data Stack:**
- **Raw Data:** `/jurisdictions/budget_data` - Water department spending
- **Standards:** `/standards/ceds_aligned` - Standardized metrics
- **Training:** `/meetings/trainings` - "Water Data 101" workshop
- **Analytics:** `/analytics/metric_views/water_usage_per_capita`
- **Outcome:** `/legislation` - New conservation ordinance passed

**Residents Learned:**
- How to query public datasets
- How to create visualizations
- How to present findings to city council

**Case Study: Norfolk, VA - Flooding Resilience**

**Problem:** Sea level rise threatens low-income neighborhoods

**Data Integration:**
```python
# Our platform combines:
- /jurisdictions/demographics          # Vulnerable populations
- /budgets/city_budgets               # Infrastructure spending
- /nonprofits (NTEE W)                # Environmental advocacy
- /meetings/public_hearings           # Community testimony
- /standards/schema_org_jsonld        # GeoJSON flood maps
```

**Data Academy Curriculum:**
1. **Week 1:** Understanding flood risk data
2. **Week 2:** Budget analysis (where does money go?)
3. **Week 3:** Creating data visualizations
4. **Week 4:** Presenting to city council

**Outcome:**
- 50 residents trained
- Community-led flood resilience plan
- $10M infrastructure investment in vulnerable areas

---

**Why Data Academies Matter:**

**Traditional Model (Fails):**
- City: "Here's a 500-page PDF budget"
- Residents: *Can't understand it, disengage*

**Data Academy Model (Works):**
- City: "Here's open data + training"
- Residents: *Build skills, create analysis, influence policy*

**Our Role:**
1. **Standardize Data:** `/standards/popolo_exports` makes data interoperable
2. **Host Training Events:** `/meetings/trainings` tracks Data Academy schedules
3. **Provide Analytics:** `/analytics/metric_views` offers ready-to-use dashboards
4. **Connect Stakeholders:** `/nonprofits` + `/officials` + `/civic_tech` = collaboration

### Open Data Impact: Evidence-Based Research

**Organization:** The GovLab at New York University (NYU Tandon School of Engineering)  
**What we use:** Evidence-based research on open data impact - validates our platform's approach and demonstrates measurable outcomes from open data initiatives.

- **Source:** https://odimpact.org/
- **Key Findings Report:** https://odimpact.org/key-findings.html
- **Full Report:** https://odimpact.org/files/open-data-impact-key-findings.pdf
- **Funded by:** Omidyar Network
- **License:** Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License

**Research Overview:**

**19 Global Case Studies** analyzing what works in open data:
- Sectoral and geographic representativeness
- First-hand interviews with stakeholders
- Measurable, tangible impact analysis
- Best practices and enabling conditions

**Economic Impact Estimates:**
- **McKinsey (2013):** $3 trillion per year global value of open data
- **Omidyar Network Study:** $13 trillion over 5 years in G20 nations

**Four Main Impact Dimensions:**

| Impact Type | Description | Our Platform Support |

| **Empowering Citizens** | Informed decision-making, participation | `/analytics/dashboards` + `/surveys` + `/factchecks` |
| **Creating Opportunity** | Economic innovation, new businesses | `/civic_tech` + `/grants` + `/nonprofits` |
| **Solving Public Problems** | Data-driven solutions to complex issues | `/community_solutions` + `/metric_views` |

**Enabling Conditions for Success:**

**1. Supply-Side (Data Providers):**
- **Quality Data:** Accurate, timely, machine-readable
- **Our Implementation:** `/standards/schema_org_jsonld`, `/standards/popolo_exports`

**2. Demand-Side (Data Users):**
- **Capacity Building:** Skills to analyze and use data
- **Our Implementation:** `/meetings/trainings` (Data Academies), `/analytics/metric_views`

**3. Intermediaries:**
- **Data Translators:** Organizations bridging supply and demand
- **Our Implementation:** `/civic_tech/brigade_chapters`, `/nonprofits/advocacy_orgs`

**4. Ecosystem:**
- **Multi-Stakeholder Collaboration:** Government + Civic Tech + Nonprofits
- **Our Implementation:** `/community_solutions/stakeholder_mapping`

**Key Challenges Identified:**

| Challenge | ODI Findings | Our Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------|--------------|------------------------|

| **Technical Capacity** | Users lack skills to analyze | Pre-built dashboards + metric views |
| **Sustainability** | Projects depend on grants | Open-source + reusable infrastructure |
| **Privacy Risks** | Potential for harm | Anonymization + ethical data standards |

**10 Recommendations for Next-Generation Open Data:**

1. **Focus on Demand, Not Just Supply** → We provide ready-to-use analytics
2. **Build User Capacity** → Data Academies tracked in `/meetings/trainings`
3. **Create Data Intermediaries** → Civic tech projects in `/civic_tech`
4. **Ensure Data Quality** → Standards compliance (`/standards`)
5. **Enable Interoperability** → OCD-ID, Popolo, Schema.org integration
6. **Measure Impact** → `/analytics/metric_views` + `/community_solutions/metrics`
7. **Sustain Engagement** → Open-source + HuggingFace hosting
8. **Mitigate Risks** → Privacy-first design, anonymization
9. **Foster Collaboration** → Multi-stakeholder `/community_solutions`
10. **Scale What Works** → Reusable templates + case studies

**How We Apply ODI Research:**

**Our Platform as Evidence-Based Open Data Infrastructure:**
- **Supply:** 90K+ jurisdictions, 3M+ nonprofits, 500K+ meetings → standardized datasets
- **Demand:** Pre-built dashboards, metric views, analytics → accessible to non-technical users
- **Intermediaries:** Civic tech projects, brigade chapters, nonprofits → data translators
- **Ecosystem:** Community solutions framework → multi-stakeholder collaboration

**Real-World Validation:**

ODI case studies demonstrate that open data works when:
1. ✅ **Data is standardized** → We use OCD-ID, Popolo, Schema.org
2. ✅ **Users have capacity** → We provide training + dashboards
3. ✅ **Intermediaries bridge gaps** → We integrate civic tech projects
4. ✅ **Impact is measured** → We track metrics + outcomes

**Example ODI Case Study Applied to Our Platform:**

**Chile's Budget Transparency (ODI Case Study):**
- **Problem:** Citizens couldn't understand government budgets
- **Solution:** Open budget data + visualization tools
- **Impact:** Increased public participation in budget process

**Our Implementation:**
```python
# Replicating Chile's success:
- /jurisdictions/budget_data       # Open budget data (supply)
- /analytics/dashboard_metrics     # Budget visualizations (demand)
- /meetings/trainings             # Data literacy programs (capacity)
- /meetings/public_hearings       # Public participation (engagement)
- /community_solutions/metrics    # Budget impact tracking (measurement)
```

```

**Why This Matters for Our Platform:**

Open Data Impact provides **evidence-based validation** that our approach works:
- ✅ Combining **supply** (data) + **demand** (analytics) + **capacity** (training) = impact
- ✅ Multi-stakeholder collaboration drives success
- ✅ Standardization and quality are essential
- ✅ Impact must be measured and documented

Their research proves: **Open data alone isn't enough. You need the ecosystem we're building.**
