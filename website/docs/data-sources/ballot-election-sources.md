## 🗳️ Primary Data Sources

### 1. Ballotpedia ⭐ **Most Comprehensive**

**Organization:** Lucy Burns Institute  
**URL:** https://ballotpedia.org/  
**API:** https://ballotpedia.org/API-documentation

**What It Contains:**
- **State ballot measures** - Propositions, referendums, constitutional amendments

**How We Use It:**
```python
# Example: Find fluoridation ballot measures
import requests

# Ballotpedia search (web scraping approach)
def search_fluoridation_measures(state_code, year):
    """Search for water fluoridation ballot measures"""
    base_url = "https://ballotpedia.org"
    search_query = f"{state_code} fluoridation ballot measure {year}"
    # Return measure details
    return {
        'measure_id': 'CA-2024-PROP-15',
        'jurisdiction_id': 'ocd-division/country:us/state:ca',
        'title': 'Water Fluoridation Mandate',
        'election_date': '2024-11-05',
        'result': 'passed',
        'yes_percentage': 67.2,
        'ballotpedia_url': 'https://ballotpedia.org/...'
    }
```

**Data Model Integration:**
```sql
-- BALLOT_MEASURE entity includes:
ballotpedia_url TEXT  -- Direct link to Ballotpedia page
measure_number TEXT   -- e.g., "Proposition 15", "Question 2"
result TEXT           -- passed, failed, pending
yes_votes INTEGER
no_votes INTEGER
yes_percentage FLOAT
```

**Use Cases:**
- ✅ Track fluoridation votes across all states
- ✅ Monitor school bond elections (dental program funding)

results = df[
    (df['state'] == 'NORTH CAROLINA') & 
    (df['year'] == 2020)
]

# Join with JURISDICTION data to link elections to jurisdictions
merged = results.merge(
    jurisdictions_df,
    left_on=['state_po', 'county_name'],
    right_on=['state_code', 'county']
)
```

**Data Model Integration:**
```sql
-- Can link to JURISDICTION for context

## 🎯 Fluoridation Vote Tracking (Use Case)

**Goal:** Track all water fluoridation ballot measures across the United States

**Data Sources Combination:**
1. **Ballotpedia** - Identify fluoridation measures, get full text
2. **OpenElections** - Get precinct-level results where available
3. **MIT Election Lab** - County-level context for political analysis

**Example Query:**
```python
# Find all fluoridation votes
fluoridation_measures = ballot_measures_df[
    ballot_measures_df['title'].str.contains('fluorid', case=False, na=False)
]

# Get results
for measure_id in fluoridation_measures['measure_id']:
    results = get_election_results(measure_id)
    # Alert advocates if measure is upcoming
    if results['status'] == 'qualified':
        send_advocacy_alert(measure_id)
```
