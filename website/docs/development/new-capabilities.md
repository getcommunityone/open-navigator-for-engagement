# 🎉 NEW CAPABILITIES SUMMARY

## What's Been Added (Based on 6 Additional Civic Tech Projects)

### ✅ 1. AI Summarization (OpenTowns Pattern)
**File**: `extraction/summarizer.py`

Generates human-readable summaries from meeting transcripts, agendas, and minutes.

**Features**:
- Executive summary (2-3 sentences)
- Key decisions (bullet list)
- Health policy items extraction
- Next actions tracking
- Quality validation
- Confidence scoring

**Usage**:
```python
from extraction.summarizer import MeetingSummarizer

summarizer = MeetingSummarizer()
summary = summarizer.summarize(event, full_transcript)

print(summary.executive_summary)
print(summary.health_policy_items)
```

**Demo**: `python extraction/summarizer.py`

---

### ✅ 2. Keyword Alert System (OpenTowns Pattern)
**File**: `alerts/keyword_monitor.py`

Real-time monitoring for oral health keywords with priority-based alerting.

**Features**:
- 6 keyword categories (fluoridation, dental access, water systems, public health, health policy, children's health)
- 4 priority levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Context extraction (relevant snippets)
- HTML email generation
- Batch scanning for multiple meetings

**Usage**:
```python
from alerts.keyword_monitor import KeywordAlertSystem

alert_system = KeywordAlertSystem()
alerts = alert_system.scan_meeting(event, full_text)

for alert in alerts:
    print(f"Priority: {alert.priority.value}")
    print(f"Keywords: {', '.join(alert.keywords_found)}")
```

**Demo**: `python alerts/keyword_monitor.py`

---

### ✅ 3. Batch Processing & Quality Metrics (LocalView Pattern)
**File**: `discovery/batch_processor.py`

Large-scale processing of 1,000+ jurisdictions with quality tracking.

**Features**:
- Batch processing (configurable batch size)
- Quality metrics per jurisdiction:
  - Completeness score (meeting discovery rate)
  - Reliability score (success rate)
  - Freshness score (last scraped)
  - Overall quality score
  - Health status (healthy/degraded/failed)
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Resume from interruption
- System-wide health reporting

**Usage**:
```python
from discovery.batch_processor import BatchProcessor

processor = BatchProcessor(batch_size=100)

for batch_result in processor.process_all_jurisdictions():
    print(f"Batch {batch_result.batch_number}: "
          f"{batch_result.success_rate:.1f}% success")
```

**Demo**: `python discovery/batch_processor.py`

## 📊 What You Can Build Now

### 1. End-to-End Meeting Analysis Pipeline
```python
# 1. Discover jurisdictions (already working)
python main.py discover-jurisdictions --limit 100

# 2. Scrape meetings (implement next)
# Would use: platform_detector.py + scrapers/legistar.py

# 3. Generate summaries
from extraction.summarizer import MeetingSummarizer
summarizer = MeetingSummarizer()
summary = summarizer.summarize(event, transcript)

# 4. Create alerts
from alerts.keyword_monitor import KeywordAlertSystem
alert_system = KeywordAlertSystem()
alerts = alert_system.scan_meeting(event, transcript)

# 5. Track quality
from discovery.batch_processor import BatchProcessor
processor = BatchProcessor()
metrics = processor.calculate_quality_metrics(url)
```

### 2. Advocate Notification System
- Scan meetings for keywords
- Generate alerts with priority
- Send HTML emails to subscribers
- Track which topics are trending

### 3. Quality Dashboard
- Monitor scraping health across jurisdictions
- Track completeness, reliability, freshness
- Identify failing scrapers
- Optimize batch sizes

## 🚀 Next Steps (Recommended Priority)

### Phase 1: Implement Scrapers (2-3 weeks) 🔥
**Status**: Foundation ready, scrapers needed

**Tasks**:
1. ✅ Platform detection (done)
2. ✅ Event models (done)
3. ⚠️ Legistar scraper (implement using Civic Scraper patterns)
4. ⚠️ Granicus scraper
5. ⚠️ Generic HTML scraper (BeautifulSoup)

**Why first**: Need actual meeting data to test summarization and alerts

---

### Phase 2: Test on Real Data (1 week) 🔥
**Status**: 76 discovered URLs ready

**Tasks**:
1. Run platform detection on 76 URLs
2. Implement top 3 platforms
3. Scrape 20-50 jurisdictions
4. Generate summaries for all meetings
5. Create alerts for oral health mentions

**Why second**: Validate the entire pipeline end-to-end

---

### Phase 3: Scale to All Jurisdictions (2-3 weeks) 🟡
**Status**: Batch processing ready

**Tasks**:
1. Expand URL discovery to all 32,333 municipalities
2. Process in batches of 100
3. Track quality metrics
4. Handle failures gracefully
5. Schedule regular updates

**Why third**: Proven system, now scale it

---

### Phase 4: Build Search & UI (2-3 weeks) 🟡
**Status**: Architecture designed

**Tasks**:
1. Set up Elasticsearch or Meilisearch
2. Index all meetings
3. Implement cross-jurisdiction search (CivicBand pattern)
4. Build web interface
5. Add user subscriptions for alerts

**Why last**: Requires substantial meeting data first

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Testing
```bash
# Test summarization without API key (shows mock output)
unset OPENAI_API_KEY
python extraction/summarizer.py

# Test with API key (generates real summaries)
export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'
python extraction/summarizer.py
```

### For Development
```bash
# Run full demo to see everything working
python examples/full_demo.py

# Check integration guide for implementation details
cat docs/SCALE_AND_SEARCH_PATTERNS.md
```

### For Production
```bash
# Process jurisdictions in batches
from discovery.batch_processor import BatchProcessor
processor = BatchProcessor(batch_size=100, max_failures=3)

# Enable quality tracking
metrics = processor.calculate_quality_metrics(url)
print(f"Overall quality: {metrics.overall_quality}/100")
```

## 🤝 Contributing

Want to implement a scraper? Start with:

1. **Check the integration guide**: `docs/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`
2. **Use existing patterns**: `discovery/platform_detector.py` shows platform detection
3. **Follow the schema**: `models/meeting_event.py` defines the event structure
4. **Add tests**: See City Scrapers testing patterns in guide

Example scraper skeleton:
```python
# scrapers/legistar.py
from models.meeting_event import MeetingEvent

class LegistarScraper:
    def scrape(self, url: str) -> List[MeetingEvent]:
        # 1. Detect if it's Legistar
        # 2. Fetch calendar page
        # 3. Extract meeting links
        # 4. For each meeting:
        #    - Parse date, title, location
        #    - Download agenda PDF
        #    - Create MeetingEvent object
        # 5. Return list of events
        pass
```
