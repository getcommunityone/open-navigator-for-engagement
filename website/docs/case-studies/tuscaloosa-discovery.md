## 🔍 MEETING PLATFORM ANALYSIS

### Legistar Legislative Management System
- **Status:** ❌ NOT DETECTED
- **Tested Endpoints:**
  - https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/tuscaloosa
  - https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/tuscaloosaal
  - https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/tuscaloosacounty
- **Result:** Tuscaloosa does not use Legistar API
- **Impact:** Cannot use automated Legistar API scraping

### Granicus Video Portal
- **Status:** ⚠️ NOT DETECTED (via automation)
- **Tested URLs:**
  - https://tuscaloosa.granicus.com
  - https://tuscaloosaal.granicus.com
- **Result:** No Granicus subdomain found
- **Note:** May still use Granicus embedded players on website
- **Manual Check Needed:** Visit meeting pages to see if videos are Granicus-hosted

### Custom CMS
- **Status:** ✅ LIKELY IN USE
- **Evidence:** Both city and county sites use custom content management
- **Impact:** Will need to scrape meeting pages directly (HTML parsing)
- **Approach:** 
  - Extract meeting agendas from /meetings and /city-council pages
  - Parse calendar for meeting dates
  - Check for embedded video players on meeting detail pages

---

## 💡 SCRAPING STRATEGY FOR TUSCALOOSA

### Option A: Video-First Approach (Recommended)
**Why:** Vimeo + YouTube channels = easiest access to meeting content

**Steps:**
1. Use Vimeo API to list all videos from https://vimeo.com/tuscaloosacity
2. Use YouTube Data API for https://www.youtube.com/@cityoftuscaloosa
3. Parse video titles/descriptions to extract:
   - Meeting type (City Council, Planning Board, etc.)
   - Meeting date
   - Agenda items (if in description)
4. Download video metadata and store in database
5. Optionally: Download video transcripts (if available) or use speech-to-text

**Pros:**
- ✅ Structured data via APIs
- ✅ No HTML parsing needed
- ✅ Video content is richest source
- ✅ Likely includes meeting audio/discussion

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ May not have written agendas attached
- ⚠️ Need to parse unstructured video descriptions

### Option B: Website Scraping Approach
**Why:** Get official agendas and documents

**Steps:**
1. Scrape https://www.tuscaloosa.com/meetings for meeting list
2. Extract agenda PDFs and document links
3. Parse meeting detail pages for:
   - Date, time, location
   - Agenda items
   - Attached documents
   - Embedded videos (if present)
4. Store structured data

**Pros:**
- ✅ Official agenda text
- ✅ PDF documents available
- ✅ Full meeting metadata

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires HTML parsing (fragile)
- ❌ Website structure may change
- ❌ Slower than API access

### Option C: Hybrid Approach (Best Coverage)
**Why:** Combine both sources for maximum data

**Steps:**
1. Scrape meeting pages for agenda metadata
2. Fetch video channels for meeting recordings
3. Cross-reference: Match videos to agendas by date
4. Enrich agenda data with video URLs
5. Create unified meeting records

**Pros:**
- ✅ Most complete dataset
- ✅ Text + video + metadata
- ✅ Redundancy if one source fails

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ More complex implementation
- ⚠️ Requires matching logic

**Recommendation:** Start with **Option A** (Video-First) to get quick results, then add **Option B** (Website) for agenda text.
