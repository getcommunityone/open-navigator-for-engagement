# Hackathon video submission ideas (reference library)

Short guide for a **CommunityOne** (or similar civic-data) submission where the **video** has to carry the “wow” as much as the product. These notes distill reference talks and pitch formats that bridge **complex data → real-world utility**.

## 2026 Gemma 4 Good — flagship question

**Pitch hook:** *What percentage of a small town’s revenue comes from speed traps?*

Use this as the **15-second opener** and the **reveal** your demo answers—not a tour of models or folders.

### National baseline (not every town is the same)

Governing’s [**Addicted to Fines**](https://www.governing.com/archive/gov-addicted-to-fines.html) analysis of local-government audits (primarily FY 2017–18; see [methodology](https://www.governing.com/archive/local-government-fines-revenue-methodology.html)) found:

| Share of general-fund revenue from fines & forfeitures | Approx. # of U.S. jurisdictions |
| --- | --- |
| **More than 10%** | **~600** |
| **More than 20%** | **~284** |
| **More than half** | **dozens** (extreme outliers) |

Additional context from the same project:

- **720+** localities reported **more than $100 per adult resident** per year from fines.
- Dependence is concentrated in parts of the **South** (e.g. AR, GA, LA, OK, TX) and some communities in **NY**—often places with a **weak property-tax base** where ticketing substitutes for ordinary revenue.

**How to say it on camera:** “Nationwide, hundreds of small governments get **double-digit shares** of their budget from fines—not taxes. Your town might be **5%** or **50%**—the point is we can’t see that from a headline. We need **budgets + meeting records** in one place.”

### What CommunityOne / Open Navigator adds

1. **Local answer:** Pull **fines & forfeitures** (and court/municipal fee lines) from the jurisdiction’s **annual financial report** or state audit extract.
2. **Meeting context:** Use **county commission / city council** agendas and minutes (e.g. Tuscaloosa County `county_01125`) so Gemma can tie **enforcement, courts, or revenue** discussion to the budget line—not just a static percentage.
3. **Reveal beat:** Map or one chart—**% of general fund from fines** for *this* place vs. the national “>10% / >20%” bands above.

**Demo path:** Colab `02_run_meeting_llm.ipynb` with `SCOPE = "fast"` (defaults to `AL/county/county_01125`, **2 meeting dates**, up to **6 PDFs**/jurisdiction) → Gatekeeper → budget PDF OCR / drift on any audio → flash **source + year** on screen.

**Caveats for judges:** “Speed trap” is colloquial; audits use **fines and forfeitures** (sometimes bundled with fees). Always cite **fiscal year** and **fund** (general vs. special). Extreme towns are outliers—lead with *your* jurisdiction’s number, then national context.

### Gapminder-style reveal (use this chart pattern)

**Reference video (≈4:47):** [Hans Rosling — *200 Countries, 200 Years, 4 Minutes* (BBC / Gapminder)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbkSRLYSojo) — full write-up in [§1. The Joy of Stats](#1-the-joy-of-stats--200-countries-200-years-in-minutes) below.

**Why it belongs in *your* demo:** Judges remember **motion**, not another static PDF screenshot. One animated scatter turns “we parsed meetings” into “**your county moved** on this metric vs. peers.”

| Gapminder element | CommunityOne / Open Navigator mapping |
| --- | --- |
| **X axis** | e.g. **% of general fund from fines & forfeitures** (Governing bands: >10%, >20%) |
| **Y axis** | e.g. **violations per homepage** (`bronze_jurisdiction_website_accessibility`) or **median household income** |
| **Bubble size** | Population (`jurisdiction` dimension) or **# of decisions** scraped |
| **Color** | State, `primary_theme` majority, or Shield **flag rate** |
| **Time slider** | **Fiscal year** or meeting `calendar_year` string from warehouse rollups |

**Automation path:** Batch Gemma → `financial_items` + `decisions[]` in bronze → SQL or Python aggregate by `jurisdiction_id` + year → export CSV → **[Flourish](https://flourish.studio/)**, **[Observable Plot](https://observablehq.com/plot/)**, or **Looker Studio** for the animation. Re-run the same notebook each quarter; only the data file changes.

**15s script:** “This dot is Tuscaloosa County. Watch what happens when we add **every Alabama county** we’ve scraped—same chart Rosling used, but for **who funds government through tickets**.”

### Alternate everyday opener (potholes & street repair)

**Pitch hook:** *Your council approved road money last month—so why is your block still full of potholes?*

Pairs the same pipeline with **Infrastructure and Capital Projects** / **Transportation and Mobility** themes: capital budget lines, paving contracts, ARPA or gas-tax allocations, and **public comment** on neglected streets in minutes or audio.

**Reveal beat:** One chart or table—**$ approved for streets** (from `financial_items` or budget PDF) next to **what was actually discussed** (deferral, change order, contractor dispute) from `policy_analysis_v1` JSON.

**How to say it on camera:** “Residents don’t live inside the audit PDF—they drive the road. We connect **the vote** to **the dollar** and the **timestamp** where they debated your street.”

## Killer idea: Scrub 100k public meetings for hate speech and safety concerns

**Pitch hook:** *What if we ran every scraped city council and county commission record—100,000 meetings—through the same safety layer we use on chatbots, and published a public “trust index” by jurisdiction?*

### Why this lands

- **Scale with a number:** “100k meetings” is concrete; judges remember it.
- **“For good” fit:** Hate speech, harassment, and dangerous content in **official** minutes/audio is a civic-trust problem—not just social media moderation.
- **Pairs with Open Navigator:** You already scrape agendas/minutes/video, run Gemma policy deconstruction (Demo 3), and **ShieldGemma-style review** (`05_safety_review/`, on by default at end of §6).

### What the pipeline does today (demo scale)

| Step | At hackathon demo | At national scale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ingest | Tuscaloosa County `county_01125`, **2 recent meeting dates**, **6 PDFs** (`SCOPE=fast`) | ~22k jurisdictions × N meetings/year |
| Understand | Gemma 4 OCR, token budget, policy JSON + thinking trace | Batch on AI Studio / Colab workers |
| Safety pass | `shieldgemma-9b` on LLM outputs → `*.shield.json` + `_summary.json` | Same pattern, one review row per artifact |
| Publish | Drive folder + optional bronze tables | Map: flagged rate by county, trend by year |

### How to say it on camera (15s + reveal)

- **Problem:** “Residents assume official meeting records are neutral—but nobody systematically checks whether **model-generated summaries** or **raw public comment** in minutes cross safety lines at scale.”
- **Reveal:** Show `_summary.json` with `reviewed_count > 0`, one **flagged** category (or a clean bill of health), then zoom out to a slide: “Pilot: 2 meetings, 6 PDFs → path to **100k meetings** with the same Shield + Gemma stack.”

### Architecture one-liner

**Scrape → Gatekeeper → Gemma analysis → ShieldGemma review → aggregate trust scores** — same Colab notebook, wider `SCOPE` and warehouse export.

**Caveats:** Automated “hate speech” labels are **screening**, not legal findings; cite Shield categories, human appeal, and that government **source** text is public record being **reviewed for downstream AI safety**, not censored at source.

---

## Killer idea: 100k decisions — reasoning scores vs. LLM narrative, and systemic bias in who wins

**Pitch hook:** *Across 100,000 local government decisions, does the “official story” in the minutes match how strong the arguments actually were—and who keeps benefiting when you follow the people, not just the votes?*

### Why this lands

- **Scale with a number:** “100k **decisions**” (not just meetings) is a research-grade civic dataset—each row is a vote, allocation, or directive with structured **arguments** and **narrative** fields.
- **“For good” fit:** Transparency is not only *what* passed but *whose reasoning dominated* and whether the same commissioners, industries, or neighborhoods show up again and again in **winning** interpretations.
- **Pairs with Open Navigator:** `prompts/policy_analysis_v1.md` already emits per-decision `arguments_for` / `arguments_against` (with `rationale`), `narrative_analysis` (dominant vs. dissenting diagnoses, `value_conflicts`, `tradeoff_analysis`), `power_map`, and stable `person_id` / `org_id` slugs—Gemma Demo 3 + Demo 4 drift at pilot scale; warehouse at national scale.

### Research questions (demo → national)

| Question | Pilot (Tuscaloosa `county_01125`, 2 dates, agenda + minutes + video) | At ~100k decisions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Reasoning quality vs. outcome** | For 5–10 decisions, score each `arguments_for` / `arguments_against` `rationale` on a simple rubric (evidence cited, specificity, logical structure). Compare to the **prevailing** `narrative_analysis.dominant_narrative` and `outcome`. | Distribution: when dissent scores *higher* on the rubric but loses the vote, flag as “narrative override.” |
| **LLM consistency** | Re-run or hold out one meeting; compare Gemma’s `dominant_narrative` + `primary_theme` to a second pass or human coder. | Aggregate **theme_audit** / COFOG flags (`*.thinking.theme_audit.json`) and disagreement rate by jurisdiction. |
| **Who champions what** | Join `narrative_champions`, `arguments_for.person_id`, `power_map`, and scraped `structured_contacts` / `_contact_images` metadata. | Graph: persons/orgs → themes won → `$` in `financial_items`; test concentration (Gini, repeat sponsors). |
| **Systemic bias (careful framing)** | One slice—e.g. **Parks and Recreation** mis-tagged as **Civil Rights and Equity** (COFOG-01)—show audit table + correction. | Stratify outcomes by `postal_code`, `county_fips`, `primary_theme`, `stakeholder_role`, `is_lobbyist`; report **disparities** with confidence intervals, not individual accusations. |

### Suggested metrics (all exportable from JSON)

1. **Argument strength score** — automated or human-on-sample: length + presence of `evidence_cited`, `underlying_causes.contested`, explicit tradeoffs in `rationale`.
2. **Narrative–argument gap** — `dominant_narrative.problem_diagnosis` vs. highest-scoring `arguments_against` when `outcome` is APPROVED (measure “winning story vs. best counterargument”).
3. **Champion recurrence** — count decisions where the same `person_id` appears in `narrative_champions` across meetings/months.
4. **Proponent profile skew** — cross-tab `arguments_for.stakeholder_role` and `is_lobbyist` against `interests_advanced` in `tradeoff_analysis` (who gains when safety, housing, or fines themes dominate).
5. **Theme–geography mismatch** — decisions where `primary_theme` disagrees with keyword audit (parks language + non-parks theme); ties to consolidated `_meeting_summary.md` theme table.

### What the pipeline does today (demo scale)

| Step | Hackathon demo | National vision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deconstruct | Demo 3 `.thinking.json` per PDF; Demo 4 chunks + `policy_drift.json` on video | Batch Gemma / warehouse `decisions[]` |
| Explain themes | `*.thinking.theme_audit.json` + COFOG table in `_meeting_summary.md` | Dashboard: misclassification rate by theme |
| People | `person_id`, contacts bronze, optional Demo 5 image triage | Entity graph across jurisdictions |
| Compare reasoning | Manual rubric on 10 rationales vs. `dominant_narrative` in notebook or Sheet | Sample 1k → model calibration; full 100k → aggregate gaps only |
| Bias (systemic) | One chart: champion concentration or theme×ZIP for county pilot | Public report: disparity metrics + methodology appendix |

### How to say it on camera (15s + reveal)

- **Problem:** “Minutes tell you the vote—not whether the **strongest argument** won, or whether the same players and neighborhoods keep winning the **story**.”
- **Reveal:** Open one decision’s JSON: read `arguments_against[0].rationale` (strong) next to `narrative_analysis.dominant_narrative` (what locked in)—then a slide: “Pilot: **N** decisions → path to **100k** with reasoning scores + champion profiles.”

### Architecture one-liner

**Scrape → Gemma policy JSON (`decisions[]`, `arguments_*`, `narrative_analysis`) → optional second-pass reasoning scorer → entity join on `person_id` / contacts → aggregate bias & gap statistics** — same schema at pilot and warehouse scale.

**Caveats for judges:** This is **research and accountability tooling**, not proof of individual bad faith. Report **systemic patterns** with transparent rubrics; keep humans in the loop for any public naming; distinguish **LLM extraction error** (theme audit flags) from **governance bias** (repeat champions, geographic skew in outcomes).

## Hackathon idea: Government website accessibility checker

**Pitch hook:** *Can a resident who uses a screen reader actually pay a fine, find meeting minutes, or contact their commissioner on the official `.gov` site?*

This pairs well with the fines-revenue story: towns that depend on ticketing often push residents to **online portals**—if those sites fail **WCAG** checks, “digital government” excludes the people most affected.

### What’s already in Open Navigator

Bulk scans of **canonical jurisdiction homepages** from `intermediate.int_jurisdiction_websites`, with results in Postgres bronze for maps and scorecards.

| Layer | Engines | Bronze table |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **HTML homepages** | [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) + Puppeteer, [Pa11y-CI](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y-ci) | `bronze.bronze_jurisdiction_website_accessibility` |
| **PDFs linked from homepages** | [veraPDF](https://verapdf.org/) (PDF/UA, PDF/A) | `bronze.bronze_jurisdiction_pdf_verapdf` |

Full runbook: **[Accessibility testing](/docs/guides/accessibility-testing)**.

### Fast demo path (one state, one reveal)

From the repo root, after `int_jurisdiction_websites` is built and `.env` has a database URL:

```bash
# HTML: WCAG-oriented violations (axe) for Alabama pilot jurisdictions
./scripts/accessibility/run_accessibility_scan.sh --engine axe --state AL

# Optional: PDF/UA on agenda/minutes PDFs discovered on those homepages
./scripts/accessibility/run_verapdf_scan.sh --state AL --max-pdfs-per-site 3
```

**Video reveal:** Side-by-side—**Tuscaloosa County** vs **City of Tuscaloosa** homepage URLs, sorted by `violation_count` in SQL or a simple chart. Call out one concrete failure (missing form label, low contrast, empty link text) and tie it to a real task (“pay court costs,” “download tonight’s agenda PDF”).

```sql
SELECT jurisdiction_id, website_url, scanner, violation_count, status, scanned_at
FROM bronze.bronze_jurisdiction_website_accessibility
ORDER BY violation_count DESC NULLS LAST
LIMIT 20;
```

### How to say it on camera

- **Problem (15s):** “My town funds itself partly from fines, then sends me to a website my blind neighbor can’t use.”
- **Demo (45s):** Run scan → show top violations → open the live `.gov` page with the same issue highlighted.
- **Action (10s):** “Advocates can rank jurisdictions, file ADA complaints with evidence, or ask councils to fix the portal—not guess.”

### Why judges like this track

- Fits **“for good”** and **accessibility** rubrics (see §3 in this doc’s reference videos).
- **Measurable** output (violation counts, PDF/UA pass-fail)—not a subjective LLM summary.
- Complements the **Gemma meeting pipeline**: meetings are useless if residents cannot **reach** them online.

**Caveats:** Automated tools catch many but not all barriers; say “axe/Pa11y flags” vs. “fully ADA compliant.” Homepage-only scans miss deep pages unless you extend the crawler.

---

## Hackathon idea: TikTok-style meeting summaries (issue-first, everyday user)

**Pitch hook:** *Your city council voted on your money last Tuesday—would you watch a 4-hour stream, or a 45-second clip that says what changed for **you**?*

Turn **official meeting intelligence** into **short-form, shareable stories** for residents who will never read minutes—framed around **issues they already care about**, not procedural jargon.

### Why this lands

- **Distribution:** TikTok, Reels, and Shorts are where **younger and working residents** get news; `.gov` livestreams are not.
- **Issue hook, not “government TV”:** Lead with **speed traps / fine revenue**, **potholes & paving**, **rent or zoning**, **school cuts**, **water bills**, **sheriff contracts**—the same hooks as the fines-revenue opener, not “Item 7 on the consent agenda.”
- **Trust through receipts:** Pair each clip with **source links**—budget line, agenda PDF page, or **`playback_url`** at `timestamp_start` from `policy_analysis_v1.md` + `media_playback_links.py` so viewers can jump to the moment in the recording.
- **“For good” angle:** Informed neighbors show up prepared; journalists and advocates get **pre-digested** frames with dissent and tradeoffs preserved (not rage-bait summaries).

### What to generate (one “card” per issue)

| Output | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Hook (≤3s text on screen)** | “This town gets **18%** of its budget from tickets.” |
| **So-what (15–30s voiceover)** | Smart Brevity from `decision.headline` + `tradeoffs` / `narrative_analysis` |
| **Receipt (5s)** | QR or URL: fines % chart, Shield-clean summary, or **Watch at 1:05:30** deep link |
| **CTA (final 3–5s)** | Dedicated slide—see [Call to action slide](#call-to-action-slide-required-closing-beat) below |

**Tone rules for scripts (prompt or post-process):**

- Second person (“your taxes,” “your commute”)—not “the commission adopted…”
- One **concrete number** or **named place** per clip when the JSON has it
- Name **who won and who lost** in plain language (`tradeoff_analysis`, dissenting frame)—avoid false balance, but don’t invent conflict
- **No legal advice**; end with “read the minutes” / “verify on the city site”

### Example issue templates (rotate by jurisdiction)

1. **Speed traps & fines** — `% of general fund from fines` (Governing baseline) + council/audio line on enforcement or court fees → ties to flagship hook above.
2. **Potholes & street repair** — hook: “They approved **$X** for roads—your street wasn’t on the list.” Pull paving / capital outlay from `financial_items`; `primary_theme` Infrastructure or Transportation; clip resident comment or engineer report from `playback_url`.
3. **Housing & rent** — zoning vote, demolition, or landlord registry debate from minutes + `primary_theme` Zoning / Housing.
4. **Public safety spend** — sheriff contract, new patrol cars, or diversion program; show **vote tally** on screen.
5. **Schools & kids** — board cuts, bus routes, discipline policy; NTEE **Education / Youth** tags from analysis JSON.
6. **Utilities & bills** — rate hike hearing; flash **$ / month** from `financial_items`.
7. **Access fail** — “They want your fine paid online” + same jurisdiction’s **axe violation** on the payment portal (combine with accessibility track).

### Pipeline sketch (builds on what exists)

```text
Scrape → Gatekeeper → Gemma policy_analysis_v1 (JSON + media_citation)
    → issue picker (theme / COFOG / fines % / keyword)
    → Gemma or template: 45–60s script + on-screen captions
    → optional: ffmpeg clip from SuiteOne/YouTube using timestamp_start_seconds
    → publish: vertical 9:16 + pinned source URL
```

**Demo path (hackathon):** One Tuscaloosa County decision with a clear **financial_items** or **fines** angle → show **JSON headline** → generated **TikTok script** → open **`playback_url`** at the cited timestamp in the browser (even if seek is manual on SuiteOne).

### How to say it on camera (15s + reveal)

- **Problem:** “Council meetings are public but invisible—unless you have four hours and a law degree.”
- **Reveal:** Play a **vertical mock** (CapCut template or slide): hook text → 20s plain-English outcome → “Source: county budget FY24 + meeting at 1:05:30.”
- **Close:** Hold the **[CTA slide](#call-to-action-slide-required-closing-beat)** for a full **3–5 seconds**—do not fade out over the demo UI.
- **Scale:** “Same Gemma pass that powers **100k meeting safety scrub** also powers **100k clips**—one per issue residents actually search for.”

### Caveats for judges

- Short-form **compresses** nuance; always show **link to full JSON / minutes** and label **AI-generated script**.
- Don’t imply endorsement by the city or platform; use **public record** framing.
- **Platform policy:** automated posting to TikTok is out of scope for a hackathon MVP—ship **scripts + captioned storyboards** or manual upload.

## Hackathon idea: Automated interactive annual report (resident edition)

**Pitch hook:** *Your city publishes a 200-page PDF every year—what if residents got the same story LVMH gives shareholders: scrollable chapters, live charts, and one click to the source vote?*

Corporate and state **interactive annual reports** are the UX benchmark. Open Navigator can **generate the data layer** from meetings + audits so you are not hand-keying charts each fiscal year.

### What “best in class” interactive reports do (patterns to steal)

These are **design patterns**, not endorsements—study structure and reuse the mechanics on **public** data.

| Example | Format | What works | Steal for civic automation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [LVMH 2025 Interactive Annual Report](https://hosting.fluidbook.com/LVMH/2025interactiveannualreport/en/30-2025-Interactive-Annual-Report-LVMH.html) | Fluidbook / long scroll | Chapter per theme; KPI tiles; HR and capital side stories | One **scroll chapter per COFOG theme** or **meeting session** (`meetings/YYYY_MM_DD/session/`) |
| [Patagonia — Work in Progress (2025)](https://www.patagonia.com/progress-report/) | Scroll + video + honest metrics | Founder letter, “we missed this target,” repair/grant totals | **Chair letter** = excerpt from `narrative_analysis`; **repairs** = capital `financial_items` vs. discussion in minutes |
| [On — 2025 Impact Progress Report](https://press.on-running.com/ons-2025-impact-progress-report-on-shares-lessons-in-impact-from-its-15-year-journey) | Narrative + data split | Pillars (Decarbonization, Circularity, Social) with KPIs | Three pillars = **Fiscal health**, **Streets & capital**, **Trust & safety** (Shield summaries) |
| [NYC Comptroller — Popular Annual Financial Report (PAFR)](https://comptroller.nyc.gov/newsroom/nyc-comptrollers-office-releases-fiscal-year-2025-popular-annual-financial-report/) | Plain-language + visuals | “Popular” companion to the technical ACFR | Auto **`_meeting_summary.md`** + one chart per chapter = PAFR for one county |
| [NY State Comptroller — local government dashboards](https://www.osc.ny.gov/local-government/publications) / Open Book | Compare all entities in a class | Pick your county vs. peers | **Gapminder scatter** or bar rank: same metric, all counties in state |
| [Multnomah County — Financial Condition Report (Tableau)](https://multco.us/info/financial-condition-report-2026) | Embedded dashboards | Revenue vs. expenditure drill-down | dbt rollups → **Looker Studio** or static embed from exported CSV |

**Common thread:** **Story first**, numbers second, **drill-down** for skeptics, **download** for journalists.

### Reusable interaction patterns (automate once, refresh quarterly)

| Pattern | Resident question it answers | Open Navigator source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **KPI hero cards** | “What changed this year?” | Sum `financial_items` by `category`; YoY compare on `fiscal_year` label |
| **Scrolly chapter** | “What did council argue about?” | `_meeting_summary.md` sections + `decisions[].headline` |
| **Receipt link** | “Show me the vote.” | `media_citation.playback_url` + `timestamp_start_seconds` |
| **Drift timeline** | “How did their story on this issue shift?” | `policy_drift.mmd` / `policy_drift.json` from Demo 4 |
| **Peer compare** | “Are we worse than neighbors?” | Warehouse by `state_code` + `scope`; fines % or accessibility count |
| **Gapminder moment** | “How do we move vs. everyone else?” | Animated scatter by `jurisdiction_id` over `calendar_year` strings |
| **Trust appendix** | “Was the AI summary safe?” | `05_safety_review/*.shield.json` aggregate |
| **Download data** | “I want the spreadsheet.” | Bronze export / `02_gemma_json` / dbt `bronze_*` tables |

### Automation pipeline (same stack as the Colab demo)

```text
Scrape agendas, minutes, ACFR PDFs, MP4
  → Gatekeeper → Gemma (policy_analysis_v1)
  → financial_items[] + decisions[] + narrative_analysis
  → dbt bronze_decisions / bronze_financial_items (warehouse)
  → rollup SQL: jurisdiction_id × fiscal_year × primary_theme
  → static site OR Flourish/Looker embeds (refresh on schedule)
  → optional: Gemma-generated “chair letter” prose per year from summaries
```

**Hackathon MVP (one weekend):**

1. **Inputs:** Tuscaloosa `county_01125`, **2 meeting dates**, budget/minutes PDFs (`SCOPE=fast`).
2. **Outputs:** Three “chapters” as markdown or a single-page site:
   - **Revenue & fines** — fines % KPI + one decision quote + Governing national band callout.
   - **Streets & capital** — top `financial_items` for paving/capital + potholes hook from minutes.
   - **Trust** — Shield `_summary.json` + “how we review AI on public records.”
3. **Wow chart:** Gapminder-style **AL counties** (or 600 jurisdictions from Open Book–style public data) with **your county highlighted**.
4. **Refresh story:** “Re-run Colab §6 + dbt seed; charts update—no designer rebuilding from Word.”

**Tools that fit hackathon time:** [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) / Docusaurus page with embedded iframes; [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/) story; [Observable](https://observablehq.com/) notebook published to HTML; Google **Looker Studio** on a bronze CSV export.

### How to say it on camera (15s + reveal)

- **Problem:** “Annual reports are written for bond analysts, not for the person who got the ticket or the pothole.”
- **Reveal:** Scroll one **auto-generated chapter** (not a PDF)—click a KPI → jump to **meeting video at 1:05:30** → show **Gapminder** dots for every county.
- **Close:** “We don’t replace the audit—we **repackage** what meetings and budgets already say, every year, from the same pipeline.”

### CTA copy (annual report track)

Add to [Call to action slide](#call-to-action-slide-required-closing-beat):

- **Headline:** Read your county’s **living annual report**
- **Subline:** Meetings + budget → charts that update · Tuscaloosa pilot
- **CTA:** Open `_meeting_summary.md` · Run Colab §6 · Embed the Flourish chart

**Caveats:** Label **AI-assisted** sections; link to primary PDFs; separate **official ACFR** from **CommunityOne narrative**; animated charts need **source table** footnotes (audit year, fund).

---

## Why this matters

Judges and voters often decide from a **short demo**: problem clarity, human face, and a single **reveal** beat a long architecture tour. Treat the recording as a **pitch product**, not an afterthought.

## Reference videos and takeaways

### 1. The “data action” narrative (civic / academic gold standard)

**Focus:** Making **invisible** systems visible so policy and residents can act.

- **Example framing:** Sarah Williams’ work on *Data Action* and projects like informal transit mapping (e.g. crowdfunded data that shaped real planning)—the pattern is: **data → map/story → decision**.

**Takeaway for CommunityOne:** Show one concrete thing your data makes **visible** that a normal person couldn’t see before (e.g. who represents them, where money or services flow, or how engagement varies by place)—and state **what someone can do next** with that view.

**Find the talk:** Search YouTube for [DATA ACTION: Using Data for a Public Good | Sarah Williams | TEDxMIT](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=DATA+ACTION+Using+Data+for+a+Public+Good+Sarah+Williams+TEDxMIT) or see the [TEDxMIT speaker page for Sarah Williams](https://tedx.mit.edu/speaker/sarah-williams).

### 2. The high-stakes pitch framework (problem → UX → live demo)

**Focus:** Winners often **anchor on the user** and a **crisp problem**, then prove the product is real with a **live or screen demo**, not slides about the stack.

- **Pattern:** “Here’s who hurts” → “Here’s the experience” → “Here’s it working in 60 seconds.”

**Takeaway for CommunityOne:** Lead with **one persona** (resident, small business, advocate) and one **job-to-be-done**; show the **shortest path** through your UI to completion.

**Find similar pitches:** Search YouTube for [EOS London hackathon winning pitch $100,000](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=EOS+London+Hackathon+winning+pitch+100000) (many uploads recap EOS Global Hackathon London finalists and winners).

### 3. Multi-team impact demos (Google Cloud / “for good” adjacency)

**Focus:** Finalist-style compilations show **variety** and **production values**: clear problem, demo, outcome; often **accessibility** or **sustainability** angles land well in “for good” tracks.

- **Example playlist-style source:** [Google Cloud Vertex AI Hackathon: Finalists Pitches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HKEyIYS_Q) (long compilation—skim for structure, overlays, and pacing).

**Takeaway for CommunityOne:** Study **picture-in-picture**: a person using the app while **data or maps update** in the same frame; keeps trust high and explains **cause → effect**.

### 4. What judges optimize for (meta: demo > raw code)

**Focus:** Experienced competitors stress that **storytelling and demo quality** often beat marginal code polish in short formats.

- **Example:** [How to Win EVERY Hackathon (from a Top 50 Hacker)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWxcEL4mg_Q)

**Takeaway for CommunityOne:** Script a **“reveal” beat**: first 15s = relatable pain; middle = your unique data angle; end = **one memorable before/after**.

## Inspirational catalog: civic data, tech & visualizations

Short talks, product stories, and case studies that show how **data + maps + humane design** change what people can *see* and *do* in civic life. Most clips are **under about seven minutes** (one TED talk runs slightly longer—called out below). Use them as **tone references** for your own demo: problem → insight → action.

### 1. The Joy of Stats — 200 countries, 200 years in minutes (Gapminder)

**Video (≈4:47):** [Hans Rosling — *200 Countries, 200 Years, 4 Minutes* (BBC / Gapminder)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbkSRLYSojo) · Live tool: [Gapminder Tools](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/)

**The problem:** Global health and wealth are often framed through static, pessimistic narratives.

**The tech:** Animated bubble charts (Gapminder-style) turn **~120,000 data points** into motion: income vs. life expectancy across countries and centuries—**play/pause**, **trails**, and **time** on one canvas.

**Why it’s inspirational:** Dry statistics become a **story of change**—the gold standard for a **reveal beat** in a hackathon video.

**Reuse in CommunityOne (required beat for many tracks):** See [Gapminder-style reveal](#gapminder-style-reveal-use-this-chart-pattern) under the flagship fines hook—map **jurisdictions** instead of countries, **fines %** or **street spend** instead of GDP, **fiscal year** instead of century. Same emotional arc: “You thought you knew your town—watch the dot move.”

### 2. Mapping “invisible” neighborhoods (humanitarian OpenStreetMap)

**Video (≈2 min tutorial):** [HOT — *What is Missing Maps?*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEEnOqmVfqM)

**Related explainer:** [HOT — *How to use the OpenStreetMap Tasking Manager*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feTGQXLf_M) · Organization: [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT)](https://www.hotosm.org/)

**The problem:** Many communities are **under-mapped**, which weakens disaster response, planning, and service delivery (see also [Herfort *et al.*, 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-82404-z) — open access on humanitarian mapping in OSM).

**The tech:** Volunteers trace roads and buildings from **satellite imagery** into **OpenStreetMap**, coordinated through the **Tasking Manager**.

**Why it’s inspirational:** Crowdsourced geodata can give vulnerable places a **digital footprint** on the same basemap the rest of the world uses.

---

### 3. Predicting crime with data visualization (predictive policing)

**Video (≈4 min explainer):** [BBC News — *How predictive policing software works*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxvyeaL7NEM)

**The problem:** Police departments need to deploy **limited patrol resources** where harm is most likely—without falling back only on intuition or reactive hot-spot lists.

**The tech:** Algorithms ingest **historical incident** data and surface **space–time “hot” cells** (heat-map style) to guide patrol plans.

**Why it’s inspirational:** It illustrates **data-driven governance** in public safety—and invites a necessary hackathon conversation about **bias, transparency, oversight, and community consent** (not only algorithmic accuracy).

---

### 4. Visualizing air quality in near real time

**Video (≈2–3 min product story):** [Plume Labs — *Flow* personal air monitor (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBy9fJ0BWZk) · Product context: [Plume Labs — Flow](https://plumelabs.com/en/flow/) *(hardware discontinued for retail; ideas about sensing + maps remain relevant)*

**The problem:** Urban air pollution is **invisible** at street scale, so people can’t easily avoid exposure or advocate with evidence.

**The tech:** **Portable sensors** plus **mobile maps** expose pollution along routes and over time.

**Why it’s inspirational:** Personal and community-scale **environmental telemetry** turns “air quality” from an abstract index into **actionable spatial behavior**.

---

### 5. Code for America — fixing the safety net (GetCalFresh)

**Video (≈3–4 min):** [Alan Williams — *Voices of GetCalFresh.org*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzf8kJk07r8) · Deeper talk: [Jake Solomon — *A User-Centered Approach to Food Stamps* (CfA Summit)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqTFi2U2Ebc) · Program: [GetCalFresh](https://www.getcalfresh.org/)

**The problem:** Long, confusing paper and web flows stop eligible households from receiving **food assistance**.

**The tech:** **User-centered design** and a **mobile-first** flow shrink a bureaucratic ordeal into a **short, guided** application.

**Why it’s inspirational:** “Civic hacking” here means **respecting residents’ time** as much as shipping code—service design as equity work.

---

### 6. The 15-minute city (proximity & urban visualization)

**Video (≈7:53 — slightly over seven minutes, still a tight TED):** [Carlos Moreno — *The 15-minute city*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ2f4sJVXAI) · Same talk on [TED.com](https://www.ted.com/talks/carlos_moreno_the_15_minute_city)

**Reading (2021):** [Carlos Moreno — *Introducing the “15-Minute City”…* (open-access journal article)](https://www.mdpi.com/2624-6518/4/1/6)

**The problem:** Sprawl and car dependence create **long commutes**, emissions, and weak neighborhood completeness.

**The tech:** **Spatial analysis** and **digital planning** tools express “complete neighborhoods” as measurable proximity to daily needs.

**Why it’s inspirational:** Data and maps help argue for a **human-scale city**—where time, carbon, and social connection are design outcomes, not afterthoughts.

---

### 7. Safe water access — mapping and field data (mWater)

**Video (overview):** [mWater — *Overview / key concepts*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ah6yX1fNM9w) · Hub: [mWater — Learn with video](https://www.mwater.co/learn-with-video)

**The problem:** Communities can’t manage what they don’t **locate and measure**—unsafe or unknown water points stay invisible to planners and residents.

**The tech:** A **mobile + cloud** platform to **map assets**, run **surveys**, and **visualize** water quality and infrastructure over geography.

**Why it’s inspirational:** It puts **lightweight M&E tooling** in the hands of local actors—classic “infra + map + feedback loop” civic tech.

---

### 8. Streetmix — civic design for everyone

**Video (community redesign using Streetmix):** [Shifter — *Help redesign this street so it’s better for all users*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G3hw4IJdmc) · Tool: [streetmix.net](https://streetmix.net) · Docs: [Streetmix documentation](https://docs.streetmix.net/)

**The problem:** Street design is often **opaque** to people who live on the corridor; PDFs and jargon block participation.

**The tech:** A **browser-based cross-section editor**—drag and drop lanes, trees, transit, and buffers to **prototype** alternatives.

**Why it’s inspirational:** Residents can **show**, not only tell, what they want—visual language bridges community and public works.

---

### 9. Data against modern slavery (supply-chain awareness)

**Video (≈2:30):** [Slavery Footprint — *How Many Slaves Work For You?*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8K-tMog1f4) · Experience: [slaveryfootprint.org](https://slaveryfootprint.org/)

**The problem:** Forced labor in global supply chains feels **distant** to everyday consumers.

**The tech:** An **interactive survey** turns lifestyle inputs into a **personalized footprint estimate** and visualization.

**Why it’s inspirational:** Dataviz makes an abstract human-rights crisis **personal**—a pattern your hackathon app can echo for other “hidden” harms.

---

### 10. “No-blame” civic problem solving (Power Civics)

**Videos (short course — pick modules that fit your pitch):** [The Citizens Campaign — *Power Civics* video library](https://thecitizenscampaign.org/power-civics-videos/watch/) · Broader search: [YouTube — “Power Civics” + Citizens Campaign](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Power+Civics+Citizens+Campaign)

**The problem:** Residents feel they lack a **repeatable path** from concern to **evidence-based** proposals in local institutions.

**The tech:** A **structured curriculum** (short videos + materials) teaches power centers, roles, and **no-blame** problem framing—**civic education as a platform**.

**Why it’s inspirational:** It treats democracy partly as **literacy and method**—skills that compound when paired with open data products.

---

### 11. Township garage sale — from paper maps to live vendor layout (Maine Township, Illinois)

**Case study:** [CivicPlus — *Modernizing Tradition: Maine Township’s Garage Sale Goes Digital*](https://www.civicplus.com/case-studies/pr/maine-township-goes-digital-successfully/)

**The problem:** A large annual community fundraiser relied on **in-person-only** vendor signup, **cash/check** payments, and a **paper map** of spaces—creating long lines, weak accessibility for non-residents and daytime workers, and occasional **double bookings** when availability wasn’t updated in real time.

**The tech:** **Online registration and payments**, an **interactive map** of vendor spaces with **live sold/available** status, **centralized records** (including walk-ins entered into the same system), and **equipment rental** inventory (e.g. tables).

**Why it’s inspirational:** It’s a concrete **“civic operations + maps + payments”** story—exactly the kind of workflow a hackathon team could reimagine with **open data**, transparent rules, and **resident-first** UX without requiring a proprietary stack.

## Call to action slide (required closing beat)

**Every hackathon submission video should end on a dedicated CTA slide**—not a trailing voiceover over code. Hold it **3–5 full seconds** so judges can screenshot it.

### Slide layout (16:9 demo or 9:16 TikTok)

| Zone | Content |
| --- | --- |
| **Headline (large)** | One imperative—what to do **next** |
| **Subline** | One proof line—jurisdiction + source |
| **Primary button / URL** | Single link or QR (repo, Colab, or lookup) |
| **Logo** | CommunityOne / Open Navigator mark (small, corner) |

### Copy templates (pick one track per video)

**Fines / speed traps**

- **Headline:** Look up your town’s **fine-revenue %**
- **Subline:** Budget + meeting sources · Tuscaloosa County pilot
- **CTA:** `github.com/…/open-navigator` · Run Colab `02_run_meeting_llm`

**Potholes / infrastructure**

- **Headline:** See **what your council approved** for your roads
- **Subline:** Capital budget + meeting vote · linked timestamp
- **CTA:** Open your county folder · Compare **$ streets** vs. **your ZIP**

**TikTok / short-form**

- **Headline:** **45 seconds** beats 4 hours of council video
- **Subline:** AI summary + link to the real recording
- **CTA:** Full meeting in bio · Comment your **ZIP** for a fact-check

**100k meetings / safety scrub**

- **Headline:** Ask for a **trust index** on public meeting AI
- **Subline:** Shield-reviewed summaries · pilot → national scale
- **CTA:** Star the repo · Request your **state** in the pilot

**100k decisions / reasoning & bias**

- **Headline:** Did the **strongest argument** win the vote?
- **Subline:** 100k decisions · champion profiles · systemic patterns
- **CTA:** Open `*.thinking.json` · Read the methodology appendix

**Accessibility**

- **Headline:** Test **your** city’s `.gov` homepage
- **Subline:** axe + Pa11y scan · violation count by jurisdiction
- **CTA:** Run `./scripts/accessibility/run_accessibility_scan.sh --state AL`

### Recording checklist

- [ ] CTA slide is the **last frame** (no terminal scroll, no credits over UI)
- [ ] URL or QR is **readable at 1080p** on a phone recording of the projector
- [ ] Spoken line matches the slide: “**Do this tomorrow:** …”
- [ ] One action only—don’t list three equal CTAs

---

## “Wow” video checklist (summary)

| Idea | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| **15-second rule** | Open with a **regular person** (or voiceover + b-roll) stating a **specific** local problem—not your stack. |
| **Magic moment** | One smooth **zoom** or transition: region → neighborhood → **one insight** (map, chart, or profile) that answers that problem. |
| **Google / familiar UI** | If the hackathon is Google-adjacent, **show** Maps, Sheets/Looker Studio, or another familiar surface **next to** your data so trust is instant. |
| **Demo over deck** | Prefer **screen capture** (e.g. OBS, Loom) of a **happy path** over architecture diagrams. |
| **Data action** | Explicitly say what became **actionable** (find, compare, contact, plan) that wasn’t before. |
| **Accessibility reveal** | Show a **scanner result** next to the live `.gov` page (axe/Pa11y violation → same element on screen). |
| **TikTok beat** | One **vertical** clip: hook stat → 20s plain English → **source URL + timestamp** on the last frame. |
| **Reasoning vs. narrative** | Side-by-side: `arguments_against` **rationale** vs. `dominant_narrative` for one decision—then a national “100k gaps” slide. |
| **CTA slide (required)** | Final **3–5s** full-screen slide: one headline + one link/QR—see [Call to action slide](#call-to-action-slide-required-closing-beat). |

## Applying this to Open Navigator / CommunityOne

- **One jurisdiction, one story:** Default Gemma run: **Tuscaloosa County, AL** (`county_01125`) with **`SCOPE=fast`** (**2 meetings**, **6 PDFs**)—fines %, Feb+May meetings, and Shield review in one pass.
- **Killer scale story:** Pilot on county_01125 → slide to **100k meetings** safety scrub (Shield + Gemma) as the national vision.
- **Research scale story:** Same `decisions[]` JSON → score **arguments** vs. **LLM dominant narrative** → join **decision-maker / proponent** profiles → report **systemic** skew (themes, ZIPs, repeat champions)—not single-villain framing.
- **Short-form branch:** Same JSON → one **issue-focused 45s script** (speed trap / fine % or **potholes / street $** hook) + optional clip at `media_citation.playback_url`.
- **Combine tracks (advanced):** Fines % + accessibility score + safety `_summary.json` for the same `jurisdiction_id`.
- **Other goals still work:** Officials lookup, nonprofit + government spend context, meeting drift—but keep **one** primary hook per video.
- **Source credibility:** Flash **audit year**, **fund name**, and **Governing / state comptroller** on screen for a second—reinforces “real data,” not a mockup.
- **End on the CTA slide (non-negotiable):** Use the [template above](#call-to-action-slide-required-closing-beat)—hold **3–5 seconds**, one headline, one link. Say aloud: “**Do this tomorrow:** run the notebook / look up your county / comment your ZIP.”
