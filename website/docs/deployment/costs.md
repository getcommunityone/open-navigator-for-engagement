---

## 💵 Optional Costs (Only If You Want Them)

### AI Summarization (OPTIONAL)
- **OpenAI API** - ~$0.01-0.05 per meeting summary (GPT-4o-mini)
  - Only needed if you want AI-generated summaries
  - Can skip this and just use transcripts
  - Or use free alternatives like Llama 2 (self-hosted)

### Cloud Deployment (OPTIONAL)
- **Databricks** - $0 (Community Edition) or paid tiers for scale
- **AWS/Azure/GCP** - Pay-as-you-go if you deploy to cloud
  - But can run entirely locally for FREE

## 📊 Cost Comparison

### ❌ What We DON'T Pay For:
- ❌ Search APIs (Google Custom Search, Bing API) - Would cost $5-50/1000 queries
- ❌ Data vendors (LexisNexis, Westlaw) - Would cost $100s-$1000s/month
- ❌ Proprietary databases - Would cost $1000s/year
- ❌ Meeting data APIs - Don't exist for most municipalities
- ❌ Legistar API access - FREE (they have public APIs)
- ❌ Granicus subscriptions - Not needed (data is public)
- ❌ Web scraping services - Not needed (we build scrapers)

### ✅ What We DO Use (All FREE):
- ✅ Official government datasets (Census, CISA, NCES)
- ✅ Academic datasets (MeetingBank, LocalView)
- ✅ Open-source civic tech (Council Data Project)
- ✅ Public government websites (Legistar, Granicus, CivicPlus, Municode)
- ✅ Open-source software (PySpark, Delta Lake, Python)

**Total: $0**

## 🎯 Why This Matters

### Sustainability
- No vendor lock-in
- No subscription fees that can increase
- No API deprecations that break your system
- Works forever as long as data is public

### Scalability
- Can process 10,000+ jurisdictions without additional cost
- No per-API-call fees
- No rate limits (except respectful web scraping)

### Transparency
- All data sources are public
- Anyone can verify the data
- Reproducible by others
- Open-source approach

## 🚀 Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: Use FREE Datasets (Week 1)
```bash
# Download MeetingBank (1,366 meetings)
pip install datasets
python discovery/meetingbank_ingestion.py

# Cost: $0
# Time: 2 hours
# Result: 1,366 meetings ready to analyze
```

### Phase 2: Download LocalView (Week 1-2)
```bash
# Visit Harvard Dataverse
# Download CSV/JSON files
# Load to Bronze layer

# Cost: $0
# Time: 1 day
# Result: 1,000-10,000 jurisdiction URLs
```

### Phase 3: Extract CDP URLs (Week 2)
```bash
# Clone CDP repos
# Extract configuration URLs
python discovery/external_url_datasets.py

# Cost: $0
# Time: 2 hours

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Don't we need to pay Legistar for API access?
**A: No.** Legistar hosts public meeting data that is FREE to access. They have public websites (e.g., chicago.legistar.com) that we can scrape for free. Some cities also provide Legistar APIs for free.

### Q: Is Granicus a paid service?
**A: Not for us.** Granicus is a platform that municipalities pay for, but the meeting videos and agendas are publicly accessible by law. We access this FREE public data via web scraping.

### Q: What about API rate limits?
**A: We use respectful web scraping** (not APIs), with delays between requests to avoid overloading servers. This is standard practice and legal for public data.

### Q: Can I really get 10,000+ jurisdiction URLs for free?
**A: Yes.** LocalView has 1,000-10,000 URLs ready to download. Council Data Project has 20 cities configured. City Scrapers has 100-500 agencies. Legistar enumeration can yield 1,000-3,000 more. All free.

### Q: What if I want to scale beyond 10,000 jurisdictions?
**A: Still free.** Just use cloud infrastructure (AWS/Azure/GCP) with pay-as-you-go pricing for compute, but the DATA access remains free. Or run on a powerful local machine for $0.

## 🎉 Bottom Line

**Every data source in this project is FREE.**

- Census data: FREE ✅
- Meeting datasets: FREE ✅
- Public websites: FREE ✅
- Software: FREE ✅
- Total cost: $0 ✅

The only potential costs are:
1. **Optional AI summarization** (~$0.01/meeting with GPT-4o-mini)
2. **Optional cloud hosting** (pay-as-you-go for compute)
3. **Your time** (engineering effort)

But all DATA access is completely FREE and always will be, because it's public government information required by law to be accessible.

**No paid services. No vendor lock-in. No API subscriptions. Just free, public data.** 🎯
