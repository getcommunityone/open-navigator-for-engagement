# Week 3: Your Gateway to 90,000+ Jurisdictions Just Got Easier

This week we tackled critical UX issues affecting the documentation site - fixing routing conflicts, restoring the homepage with logo, and updating all navigation links to work correctly.

## 🔧 What We Fixed

### 1. Homepage "Page Not Found" Error

**Problem:**
- `http://localhost:3000/` showed "page not found"
- Custom homepage at `src/pages/index.tsx` couldn't render
- CommunityOne logo missing
- Routing conflict with Docusaurus configuration

**Solution:**
- Changed `routeBasePath` from `/` to `/docs/`
- Docs now served at `/docs/` path
- Custom homepage renders at root `/`
- Logo displays correctly

### 2. Updated All Navigation Links

Fixed **7 files** with 155 insertions:

**Configuration Updates:**
- `docusaurus.config.ts` - Navbar, footer, logo links
- `src/pages/index.tsx` - Homepage pathway cards, CTA buttons

**Documentation Updates:**
- `intro.md` - Updated all internal links to `/docs/` prefix
- `for-advocates.md` - Fixed policy maker navigation
- `for-developers.md` - Corrected developer guide links
- `dashboard.md` - Updated dashboard references
- `citations.md` - Added Open Data Impact section

### 3. New URL Structure

With `routeBasePath: '/docs/'`:

| What You Want | Correct URL |
|---------------|-------------|
| Homepage | `http://localhost:3000/` |
| Introduction | `http://localhost:3000/docs/intro` |
| Citations | `http://localhost:3000/docs/data-sources/citations` |
| Policy Makers Guide | `http://localhost:3000/docs/for-advocates` |
| Developer Guide | `http://localhost:3000/docs/for-developers` |
| Dashboard | `http://localhost:3000/docs/dashboard` |

## ✨ Homepage Features

The new custom homepage includes:

**Header:**
- CommunityOne logo (SVG)
- "Open Navigator for Engagement" branding
- Tagline: "Find opportunities in local meetings and budgets"

**Audience Pathways:**
Two cards guiding users based on role:
- 📊 **Policy Makers & Advocates** → `/docs/for-advocates`
- 🛠️ **Developers & Technical Users** → `/docs/for-developers`

**Feature Highlights:**
- 📄 Meeting Minutes & Financial Documents (90,000+ jurisdictions)
- 🤖 Automated Analysis (AI-powered document processing)
- 💰 Words vs Money (Budget vs meeting minute correlation)
- 🔍 Free Public Data (Census, school district, nonprofit data)
- 🗺️ Visual Map (Geographic opportunity discovery)

**Call-to-Action:**

- Access documentation sections
- Explore data sources
