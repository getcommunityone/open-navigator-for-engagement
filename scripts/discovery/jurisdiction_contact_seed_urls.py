Built-in contact / directory page seeds for pilot jurisdictions.

Some official bios live on a different host than ``int_jurisdiction_websites`` (e.g. Sweet Grass
County commissioners on ``sgcountymt.gov`` while NACO lists ``sweetgrasscountygov.com``). Seeds are
merged with ``--contact-seed-urls`` and enqueued at crawl start.

Disable with ``SCRAPED_CONTACT_BUILTIN_SEEDS=false``.
