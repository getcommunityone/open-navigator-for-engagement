# General Examples & Demos

This directory contains general demonstration scripts and case studies that showcase the Open Navigator platform's capabilities.

## Demo Scripts

### Complete Workflow Examples
- **example_workflow.py** - Demonstrates the complete policy analysis pipeline with all agents
- **full_demo.py** - Full system demonstration
- **integration_demo.py** - Integration demonstration across multiple components

### Specific Feature Demos
- **legislative_map_demo.py** - Demonstrates legislative tracking and mapping features
- **process_multiple_formats.py** - Shows processing of various document formats

## Case Studies

### Tuscaloosa Accountability Reports
These demonstrate evidence-based accountability dashboards for policy advocacy:

- **tuscaloosa_accountability_report.py** - Generate accountability dashboards exposing gaps and delays
- **tuscaloosa_decision_analysis.py** - Analyze decision-making patterns
- **tuscaloosa_political_economy.py** - Political economy analysis

Most demo scripts can be run directly:
```bash
python scripts/examples/example_workflow.py
python scripts/examples/tuscaloosa_accountability_report.py
```

Make sure you have:
1. Activated the virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
